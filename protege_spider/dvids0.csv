1,X-35 History Inspires F-35 Capability,"21st century threats required a transformation in combat aircraft. Military aviation capabilities at the turn of the century were set to be outpaced by the advanced sensors and weapons systems of U.S. adversaries. An elite team was assembled to develop the Fifth Generation combat capability required to secure air dominance in a rapidly-accelerating digital age.  

The resulting air systems (F-35, F-22) employed today are defined by supersonic speeds, stealth properties, precision weaponry, and software designed to evolve at the speed of global threats. None of these capabilities would have been possible without the groundbreaking work of those who matured futuristic concepts into operational reality. 

In her current position as the F-35 Joint Program Office’s Executive Director, Tanya Skeen recently reflected on her beginnings as a flight sciences engineer on the X-35 Program. Her love of space and airplanes set her on a path to contribute to ground-breaking technologies over the course of her career as an engineer, tester and accomplished program manager.

“I’m grateful to have been a part of the early days of the [X-35] Program, and to jump back in now in a leadership role on the [F-35] Program at this time; it’s an incredible honor. I never would have imagined, when I was a young engineer writing code and doing testing that I’d have the opportunity to work on the Program again at this level, and at this stage in capability delivery and operations C it’s awesome.”

The X-35, a concept demonstrator aircraft (CDA) developed by Lockheed Martin, would later be known as the ‘Joint Strike Fighter’. Following extensive development and tests on U.S. Service aircraft variants, the Fifth Generation air system entered production in the 2000s as the F-35 Lightning II. On October 24, 2000, Lockheed Martin's X-35A CDA completed its first flight from Palmdale, California, to nearby Edwards Air Force Base, using just over 2,000 feet of runway to take-off before climbing to 10,000 feet with the gear down. As described in 2000 by Tom Morgenfeld, Lockheed Martin’s X-35 head test pilot: “This aircraft looks and flies like a fighter.” 

The test flights subsequently carried out by the X-35 government-industry team validated engineering designs, and provided data later applied to production aircraft as the X-35 program matured into the F-35 program.

Being a test engineer appealed to many of Skeen’s natural interests. “Test gives us data, and I have always appreciated how data helps me understand things. My love of data, and my love of solving problems is what made test so appealing to me.”  When asked about career progression, Skeen shared that her husband, an active duty Air Force Officer, was also a test engineer. “The Air Force moved us to test places, and if you move to test places, you’d better love test especially because test bases tend to be a bit remote!”  

Engineering innovation was inspirational to many who worked on the X-35 program - new ideas and designs were being presented all the time to achieve results, but didn’t always work as planned.  The team learned resilience, and became even more innovative when recovering from failures. “When you speak about innovation - we saw drawings and mock ups of engines, and there was a lot of testing of engines. We refined data and learned from failures along the way,” Skeen recalled. “We tried, and failed…and we tried again.” 

From that experience, she learned a memorable leadership and life lesson. “Things don’t always work the way we expect, but we have to learn and adjust, and not let smaller failures get in the way of truly big successes.” 

When asked to recount the most ground breaking accomplishment she participated in during her days on the X-35 program, Skeen recalled working on the X-35B. “We were a young crew, writing control laws on the B [U.S. Marine Corps, short takeoff variant] aircraft, trying to get an airplane to move like it was a helicopter…which was very interesting for an aeronautical engineer.” Previous vertical lift aircraft had employed a direct lift engine, but the X-35B design included a new, shaft-driven lift fan system. “Building a lift fan had never been done before. I worked on flight sciences, and unlike most people on the flight sciences team, I got to work across the department C aerodynamics testing, propulsion testing, and coding of control laws - and pulling that all together. It was really exciting and rewarding” 

Skeen’s early years as an engineer shaped her leadership style as an industry executive, and are applied daily in her current Department of Defense role as a member of the Senior Executive Service (SES), and Executive Director of the F-35 Joint Program Office.  

“Leadership in the Department [Department of Defense] demands and requires that we bring data to drive our decision making. There are plenty of hard problems that we solve every day in acquisition. In addition to my test background, I appreciate the business side of acquisition as well. I love to talk to with our contracting community about the best acquisition strategy for a Program. Through those strategy conversations, we use data to define how best to tackle those hard problems.”

When asked what her current professional growth looks like, Skeen related that she’s focusing on personal attributes, such as communication skills and effective listening. “The engineering and hard sciences comes easy for me, but I have to also focus on improving my “softer side” and focusing on how I engage with people. I have an executive coach who helps me with blind spots, and [he] is one of the most valuable resources I have in this role.” Skeen focused on prioritizing her family as they moved from place to place during their military family experience. “My best advice is don’t get too caught up in the “perfect career”…do what makes sense to you, take on challenging positions that stretch you professionally, work really hard in every job, and remember your family is most important. Success will follow.”

Reuniting with former X-35 colleagues to celebrate the program’s anniversary and accomplishments is an exciting prospect for Tanya Skeen. “We formed a close bond, and focused on an ambitious mission that became a reality…it’s a huge privilege to be a part of that group and our shared experience.” 

Now, the F-35 Lightning II is a reality, with over 560 aircraft deployed around the globe, more than 300,000 flight hours logged, and air system capability that is unsurpassed in combat aviation. Being associated with the F-35 program over time has fortified Skeen’s belief that PEOPLE are the most important aspect of technology and innovation. “It takes a lot of smart, dedicated folks to deliver a technological marvel like the F-35. It doesn’t happen without the people writing contracts, managing finances, sustaining the air system, and working future development to keep this program healthy and relevant; the human factor simply cannot be automated.” 

As the F-35 Enterprise expands globally with each consecutive year, Skeen provided her outlook for the future of the program. “This air system, and F-35 capabilities are changing the way we look at warfighting. We are learning so much through current operations and our partners. With every exercise and each deployment, the impact of F-35 around the world is becoming more significant and profound.”",2020/11/4,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/382467/x-35-history-inspires-f-35-capability,"ARLINGTON, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿,X-35的历史激发了F-35的能力,21世纪的威胁要求战斗机进行改造。在世纪之交，美国对手的先进传感器和武器系统将超越军用航空能力。组建了一支精英团队，发展第五代作战能力，以确保在快速加速的数字时代保持空中优势。由此产生的今天使用的空中系统（F-35、F-22）由超音速、隐身性能、精确武器和旨在以全球威胁速度发展的软件来定义。如果没有那些将未来概念成熟化为作战现实的人的开创性工作，这些能力都不可能实现。Tanya Skeen目前担任F-35联合项目办公室的执行主任，她最近回顾了自己作为X-35项目飞行科学工程师的最初经历。她对太空和飞机的热爱使她在作为工程师、测试人员和有成就的项目经理的职业生涯中走上了一条为开创性技术做出贡献的道路。“我很高兴能够成为[X-35]项目早期的一部分，现在又回到了[F-35]项目的领导岗位上。”这是一个令人难以置信的荣誉。当我还是一名年轻的工程师编写代码并进行测试时，我从未想过我会有机会在这个级别上，在能力交付和操作的这个阶段，再次参与该计划――这太棒了。”X-35，一架概念演示飞机（CDA）由洛克希德・马丁公司开发，后来被称为“联合攻击战斗机”。在对美国军用飞机变型进行了广泛的开发和测试之后，第五代空中系统作为F-35 Lightning II于2000年代投入生产。2000年10月24日，洛克希德・马丁公司的X-35A CDA完成了从加利福尼亚州帕尔代尔到附近爱德华兹空军基地的第一次飞行，使用了刚刚超过2000英尺的跑道起飞，然后降下起落架爬升到10000英尺。正如洛克希德・马丁公司X-35机头试飞员汤姆・莫根菲尔德（Tom Morgenfeld）在2000年所描述的：“这架飞机看起来和飞行起来都像一架战斗机。”随后，X-35政府工业团队进行的试飞验证了工程设计，随着X-35计划逐渐成熟为F-35计划，并提供了后来应用于生产飞机的数据。作为一名测试工程师吸引了Skeen的许多自然兴趣。“测试为我们提供了数据，我一直很欣赏数据如何帮助我理解事物。我对数据的热爱，以及我对解决问题的热爱，使测试对我如此有吸引力。”当被问及职业发展时，斯凯恩说，她丈夫是一名现役空军军官，也是一名测试工程师。“空军把我们带到了测试地点，如果你搬到了测试地点，你最好喜欢测试，特别是因为测试基地往往有点偏远！”工程创新对许多从事X-35项目的人来说是一种鼓舞――为了取得成果，不断有新的想法和设计出现，但并非总是按计划进行。团队学会了韧性，在从失败中恢复时变得更加创新。斯肯回忆道：“当你谈到创新时，我们看到了发动机的图纸和实物模型，并对发动机进行了大量测试。我们改进了数据，并从失败中吸取了教训。”。“我们尝试了，但失败了……我们又尝试了。”从那次经历中，她学到了一堂难忘的领导力和人生课。“事情并非总是按照我们预期的方式进行，但我们必须学习和调整，不要让较小的失败阻碍真正的大成功。”当被问及她在X-35项目期间参与的最具开创性的成就时，斯肯回忆起在X-35B上的工作。“我们是一名年轻的机组人员，在B[美国海军陆战队，短距起飞变体]飞机上编写控制法规，试图让飞机像直升机一样移动……这对航空工程师来说非常有趣。”以前的垂直升降飞机使用了直升发动机，但X-35B设计包括一个新的，轴驱动提升风扇系统。“以前从未建造过升降机风扇。我从事飞行科学工作，与飞行科学团队中的大多数人不同，我在整个部门工作――空气动力学测试、推进测试和控制律编码――并将这些工作结合在一起。这真的很令人兴奋和有意义。”斯凯恩早年的工程师生涯塑造了她作为行业高管的领导风格，她目前担任国防部高级执行官（SES）成员和F-35联合项目办公室执行主任，每天都在发挥作用。“国防部的领导能力”要求并要求我们提供数据来推动我们的决策。在收购过程中，我们每天都要解决很多难题。除了我的测试背景外，我也很欣赏收购的商业方面。我喜欢与我们的签约社区讨论项目的最佳收购策略。通过这些在战略对话中，我们使用数据来定义如何最好地解决这些难题。”当被问及她目前的职业发展情况时，Skeen表示，她专注于个人特质，如沟通技能和有效倾听。“工程和硬科学对我来说很容易，但我还必须专注于改善我的“软面”并专注于如何与人交往。我有一位高管教练，他帮助我克服盲点，而[他]是我在这个岗位上最有价值的资源之一。”斯凯恩专注于优先考虑她的家人，因为他们在他们的军事家庭经历中从一个地方搬到另一个地方。“我最好的建议是，不要过于沉迷于“完美的职业”……做对你有意义的事，接受挑战性的工作，在每一份工作中都要努力工作，记住你的家庭是最重要的。成功就会随之而来。”与X-35的前同事团聚，庆祝该项目的周年纪念和成就，对Tanya Skeen来说是一个激动人心的前景。“我们建立了紧密的联系，专注于一项成为现实的雄心勃勃的任务……成为该团队的一员和我们的共同经历是一种巨大的荣幸。”现在，F-35闪电II已经成为现实，全球部署了560多架飞机，飞行时数超过30万小时，以及在作战航空中无与伦比的空中系统能力。随着时间的推移，与F-35项目的联系加强了斯肯的信念，即人是技术和创新最重要的方面。“要创造F-35这样的技术奇迹，需要很多聪明、敬业的人。如果没有人撰写合同、管理财务、维护空气系统和致力于未来发展，以保持该计划的健康和相关性，这是不可能的；人为因素根本无法自动化。”随着F-35企业每年在全球扩张，Skeen对该计划的未来进行了展望。“这一空中系统和F-35的能力正在改变我们看待作战的方式。我们通过当前的作战行动和我们的合作伙伴学到了很多东西。随着每次演习和部署，F-35在世界各地的影响越来越显著和深远。”
2,Denmark Welcomes First F-35,"CRYSTAL CITY, Va. (APRIL 08, 2021) On April 7, Denmark's first F-35A, L-001, was delivered to the Royal Danish Air Force. The Kingdom of Denmark commemorated the milestone with members of the Ministry of Defence, Danish Defence, the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization, the Royal Danish Air Force, U.S. Military Services, and industry partners at Lockheed Martin's Fort Worth, Texas facility.

""The roll-out ceremony of our first F-35 is a huge milestone for Denmark. The F-35 will play a major transformational role, not only for the Danish Air Force but for the Danish Armed Forces,"" said F-35 Joint Program Office, Denmark National Deputy, Col. Jonas Ottosen.

Denmark is the fifth European NATO nation to fly and operate the F-35. Their addition strengthens NATO's fifth-generation airpower and unites them with the air defenses of the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway.

""Denmark has been a partner in the F-35 program for more than 20 years. The F-35 partnership is an essential platform that unites its participants. Operationally and strategically, the F-35 will surpass anything we can do with our current inventory. It will continue to strengthen cooperation with our partners and allies. For our defense industrial base, the program has been a catalyst for technological development, closer industrial cooperation, and positioning Danish companies in a globalized supply chain,"" continued Col. Ottosen.

L-001 made its first flight in January 2021 and completed a series of comprehensive tests to ensure that all systems function properly in the aircraft before delivery. The aircraft will arrive at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona next week to facilitae the training of Danish F-35 pilots and maintainers.

The construction of brand new Danish F-35 facilities at Air Base Skrydstrup in Vojens, Denmark, specifically designed to support the fifth-generation aircraft, began in 2020. In October of 2023, Denmark is scheduled to receive their First F-35 Aircraft Arrival in-country. 

The F-35 is the premier multi-mission strike fighter of choice for three U.S. services, seven international partners, and six Foreign Military Sales customers. The F-35 routinely demonstrates its unmatched capabilities at the hands of our joint and international warfighters, performing combat operations from land and the sea. The F-35 system combines stealth, advanced weapons and sensors, and information sharing with joint and allied forces to dominate current and future threats.

3,F-35 Joint Program Office begins deployment of new logistics hardware to F-35 squadrons,"ARLINGTON, Va., August 9, 2021 C The F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office (JPO), in partnership with Lockheed Martin, has achieved a milestone in the transition to the modernized Operational Data Integrated Network (ODIN) F-35 logistics information system by deploying ODIN hardware to two F-35 squadrons.

Personnel from the JPO, Lockheed Martin, and local squadron maintenance crews completed the installation of new computer hardware called the ODIN Base Kit (OBK) July 16 at Naval Air Station Lemoore, California, in support of Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 125, and Aug. 6 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, in support of the 422nd Test and Evaluation Squadron (TES). 

These are the first of 14 scheduled OBK deployments from July 2021 through early 2022. 

With the installations at Lemoore and Nellis, there are three OBKs installed with F-35 Squadrons C one from each U.S. service. In September 2020, the United States Marine Corps test squadron VMX-1 at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma, Arizona, successfully evaluated the ODIN hardware over 30 days of testing, and the OBK hardware has remained in service there since installation.  There is one additional OBK installed at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland, where it is a key element of the F-35 Integrated Test Force’s flight test operations.  

As announced early in 2020, ODIN is the planned replacement of the F-35 Autonomic Logistics Information Systems (ALIS).  The successful deployment of this new ODIN hardware is an important step in the evolution to a modern, capable, and affordable logistics information system for the F-35 fleet.   

Designed by Lockheed Martin, the OBK replaces the legacy ALIS computer hardware called the Standard Operating Unit unclassified (SOU-U) server.  The new ODIN hardware is 75% smaller and lighter, has a nearly 30% lower cost, and is designed to run both the current ALIS software, as well as its future replacement ODIN software applications and data environment.

“The reduction in size and weight [of the OBK], not to mention the massive increase in performance, will provide maximum flexibility in the Air Force’s ability to project airpower,” said Air Force Master Sgt. James Ferrell, F-35 lead production superintendent, Bolt Aircraft Maintenance Unit, 57th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron (AMXS), Nellis AFB, Nevada. The 57th AMXS owns and operates the 422nd TES’ maintenance equipment.

The installations at Lemoore and Nellis were both accomplished by military maintenance personnel assisted by experts from JPO and Lockheed Martin.  At each site, the hardware installation and set-up were complete and systems ready for operation in a matter of days, demonstrating the suitability and ease of use for administrators of this new hardware.

Planning is underway to replace all remaining SOU-U servers starting in 2022. The timeline to complete upgrades will depend on available funding and squadron operational constraints.

“With this new server hardware, the JPO now has a viable successor to the aging ALIS system hardware that offers a significant performance upgrade to F-35 units, at lower cost, and in a readily supportable package,” said Air Force Col. Dan Smith, JPO Maintenance Systems director charged with overseeing ALIS and ODIN. “OBK allows us to replace hardware before obsolescence issues become critical, and provides faster service to the maintainers.” 

The new hardware design offers numerous improvements over the existing ALIS servers. Immediately obvious is its reduced size, with two transportable suitcase-sized cases replacing a full rack of electronics, thus reducing weight from over 800 pounds to just two modules weighing under 100 pounds each. Its next-generation computing performance improves the user experience by demonstrating processing times decreased by as much as 50%, system interactions with similarly reduced wait times, and improved efficiency in system administration. And because the servers are based on currently available commercial components, they are inherently more serviceable and supportable.

Looking ahead, JPO and Lockheed Martin are working together to further extend affordability advantages of the OBK, including evaluating the potential to host multiple operating squadrons on a single server, designing and evaluating similarly improved hardware for other classified functions, and further reducing the workload of system administrators at the installed sites.  These benefits will be realized as the OBK is extended across the entirety of the F-35 fleet, Smith added.

###",2021/8/9,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/402674/f-35-joint-program-office-begins-deployment-new-logistics-hardware-f-35-squadrons,"ARLINGTON, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿,F-35联合项目办公室开始向F-35中队部署新的后勤硬件,弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿，2021年8月9日―F-35 Lightning II联合项目办公室（JPO）与洛克希德・马丁公司合作，通过向两个F-35中队部署ODIN硬件，在向现代化作战数据综合网络（ODIN）F-35后勤信息系统过渡的过程中实现了一个里程碑，7月16日，当地中队维修人员在加利福尼亚州莱莫尔海军航空站完成了名为ODIN Base Kit（OBK）的新计算机硬件的安装，以支持打击战斗机中队（VFA）125；8月6日，在内华达州内利斯空军基地完成了名为ODIN Base Kit（OBK）的新计算机硬件的安装，以支持第422测试和评估中队（TES）。这是2021年7月至2022年初计划的14次OBK部署中的第一次。在Lemoore和Nellis安装后，有三个OBK安装了F-35中队――每个美国军种一个。2020年9月，位于亚利桑那州尤马市海军陆战队航空站（MCAS）的美国海军陆战队VMX-1测试中队在30天的测试中成功评估了ODIN硬件，OBK硬件自安装以来一直在那里使用。另外还有一个OBK安装在马里兰州帕塔克森特河海军航空站，它是F-35综合测试部队飞行测试行动的关键要素。正如2020年初宣布的那样，ODIN计划取代F-35自主后勤信息系统（ALIS）。这种新型ODIN硬件的成功部署是F-35机队向现代化、功能强大、价格合理的后勤信息系统发展的重要一步。由洛克希德・马丁公司设计的OBK取代了传统的ALIS计算机硬件，称为标准操作单元非机密（SOU-U）服务器。新的ODIN硬件体积更小、重量更轻75%，成本降低近30%，设计用于运行当前的ALIS软件，以及未来替代的ODIN软件应用程序和数据环境更不用说性能的大幅提升，将为空军提供最大的灵活性，以投射空中力量，”内华达州内利斯空军基地第57飞机维修中队（AMXS）博尔特飞机维修队F-35首席生产总监、空军少校詹姆斯・费雷尔（James Ferrell）说。第57届AMXS拥有并运营第422届TES的维修设备。Lemoore和Nellis的安装均由军事维修人员完成，并由JPO和洛克希德・马丁公司的专家协助完成。在每个站点，硬件安装和设置都已完成，系统在几天内即可投入运行，这证明了这种新硬件的适用性和易用性。正在计划从2022年开始更换所有剩余的SOU-U服务器。完成升级的时间表将取决于可用的资金和中队作战限制。“有了这种新的服务器硬件，JPO现在有了一个可行的替代品，取代了老化的ALIS系统硬件，以较低的成本和易于支持的包件，为F-35部队提供了显著的性能升级。”负责监督ALIS和ODIN的JPO维修系统总监、空军上校丹・史密斯（Dan Smith）说。“OBK允许我们在过时问题变得严重之前更换硬件，并为维护人员提供更快的服务。”新的硬件设计对现有ALIS服务器进行了大量改进。最明显的是它的体积缩小了，两个可移动的行李箱大小的箱子取代了一个完整的电子机架，从而将重量从800磅减少到两个模块，每个模块的重量不到100磅。它的下一代计算性能通过证明处理时间减少了多达50%，系统交互减少了等待时间，提高了系统管理效率，从而改善了用户体验。而且由于服务器基于当前可用的商用组件，因此它们本质上更易维护和支持。展望未来，JPO和洛克希德・马丁公司正在合作，进一步扩大OBK的可负担性优势，包括评估在一台服务器上托管多个作战中队的可能性，为其他分类功能设计和评估类似改进的硬件，并进一步减少已安装站点系统管理员的工作量。史密斯补充道，随着OBK在整个F-35机队中的推广，这些好处将得以实现。有关更多信息，请访问www.jsf.mil###
4,FRCE marks 100th F-35 induction,"Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE) marked a milestone in its support of the F-35 Lightning II program when the depot inducted its 100th F-35 for modifications June 11. 

The induction signifies more than just a number C it represents eight years of efforts to stand up and grow the F-35 modification line at the depot, said FRCE Commanding Officer Col. Thomas A. Atkinson. 

“We are very proud to support the F-35 platform and achieve this important milestone,” Atkinson said. “The F-35 maintenance concept is different than what we see on other platforms. Our experience on these 100 jets has made us stronger as a command and we look forward to continuing our contribution as more F-35s are fielded.”

The depot has been able to meet this milestone only through the diligence and commitment of the team servicing the aircraft, said FRCE F-35 Branch Head Ike Rettenmair.

“The team has come a long way since the first induction, and is one of the most dedicated teams I have been a part of,” Rettenmair said. “This platform has challenges that are unlike most others, and the team takes them head on. FRCE is 100 percent behind the partnered effort to make the F-35 program successful and, although we are only one piece of the pie in the enterprise, we take pride in supplying the warfighter with a capable and quality aircraft.”

In addition to marking a milestone, the 100th F-35 induction also serves as a stepping stone to the future of the program at the depot, said Matt Crisp, FRCE site lead for the F-35 Joint Program Office. An additional workload of F-35 components, a new lift fan facility and expansion of the F-35 aircraft line’s capacity are all coming into view on the horizon. 

“This is not the finish line,” Crisp said. “We’re just getting up to speed at this point. We’ve come a long way, and things are looking good going forward for FRC East and the people who work here, who live here, and rely on this program as how they support their families. There are a lot of really good things coming to our area.”

Rettenmair said he also looks forward to watching the program continue to grow. 

“Although 100 is a great milestone, there are still may more years to go in support of the F-35,” he said. “I have only been on the F-35 program for a short stint and I’m still getting my feet wet; however, it didn’t take me long to realize this is a special team and I’m glad to help lead the way into the future. I hope I’m still here to see our 200th aircraft induction and beyond, as FRCE continues to meet the mission with pride, teamwork and C at times C frustration, and always safely and with quality.”  

FRCE inducted its first F-35 aircraft for modification in July 2013 after having just eight months to prepare for the workload, said Jeanie Holder, the F-35 Joint Program Office induction manager at FRCE. Despite the compressed timeline, the facility was able to induct its first F-35B short takeoff-vertical landing variant on schedule, and has since proven capabilities on the remaining two aircraft variants: the F-35C carrier variant, and the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant. 

“There have been a lot of hands-on work and tireless hours executed to make this depot sufficient to support a fifth-generation jet that, at the time, we weren’t used to doing here,” Holder said. “For us to hit 100 aircraft is a huge accomplishment that shows just how hard we’ve collectively worked. It’s not just FRC East or the F-35 Joint Program Office or Lockheed Martin C it’s been a real team effort.”

That team effort has made the program more efficient as relationships between key stakeholders have developed and strengthened, noted Allen Williamson, an overhaul and repair supervisor on the F-35 line. 

“A lot of our government and industry partnerships have grown, and we’re getting buy-in from the partners to be able to turn these jets around as quickly as possible,” Williamson noted. “We’ve opened up and taken advice from Lockheed Martin and the Joint Program Office, and when we run into an issue we now have a consolidated team coming together to address it and figure out a way forward that works for all of us. I think we’ve been really successful at that.”

Joseph Simonds, an F-35 airframes work leader who has been with the program since the very first induction eight years ago, said this teamwork has helped the program make great strides in efficiency.

“We've gotten better, we’ve gotten quicker,” Simonds said. “A lot of the processes have gotten smoother because, just like any other program, when we first started there were a lot of unknowns. Over the years, everything has slowly fallen into line and the program gets better with that. Now it’s like, Here’s everything you need to do your job, so have at it.”

While the program has been improving efficiency and strengthening partnerships, the workforce modifying the aircraft has made gains in knowledge, Williamson added, which helps them quickly and competently address any new aircraft issues that might arise. 

“We still run into new hurdles all the time, but teamwork has gotten us to the 100th induction and will take us well beyond,” he said. “We know where to go when we need help, and who can help us, and we don’t delay in going there.

“The knowledge our mechanics have accumulated in just 100 jets, it’s great,” Williamson continued. “It’s amazing that they can troubleshoot these jets with the knowledge they’ve developed through working on these aircraft, taking things apart and putting them back together, and they can go in and pinpoint problems in a timely manner.”

The facilities, skills and knowledge of the artisans and strong partnerships that have facilitated the growth of the F-35 program at FRCE since its first induction have laid the groundwork for future success, Crisp said. 

“It is pretty remarkable when you think about where we've come from eight years ago, strike a baseline here and then look forward at what's coming this way,” he said. “Over these eight years, we haven’t just added dock space and added people; we’ve developed every one of the supporting logistical elements that put the tools in place so the production floor can go and execute, and gotten better, faster and stronger at what we’re doing.

“We're talking 100 airplanes C that's hundreds of thousands of hours of touch labor, and engineering and logistics support, just on the aircraft that have come through FRC East, not to mention the Rapid Response Team, depot field teams, and weight and balance teams going out to the fleet to assist. We’re talking parts manufacturing, the facilities and infrastructure we have improved, building those relationships; these have all been absolutely critical for us to have gotten to where we are, and to get us to where we need to go in the future.”

As the F-35 program continues to grow at the depot, Crisp said he anticipates even further development of the key support elements. For example, FRCE declared capabilities on several F-35 components in 2020 - meaning FRCE is now a verified source of repair and testing for these items C and is on track to declare for additional components this year and in the future. A lift fan facility scheduled for groundbreaking this year will provide FRCE with one of only two sites in the world that can service that system, and the F-35 program has plans for expanding the amount of aircraft FRCE can accommodate at once. 

“FRC East is absolutely critical not only to the United States Marine Corps, but to all of our international partners who are procuring F-35B aircraft, of which there are multiple,” Crisp said. “There’s a lot of work, a lot of jobs and a lot of touch labor that we’re going to need in the future, so that’s very exciting. And then when you look three to five years out, we’re going to start having active F-35 squadrons that are arriving here at Cherry Point C we’ll be able to walk down the street to a whole flight line of deployable F-35s and share knowledge and expertise with the squadrons. We’ll continue to build relationships that will benefit both the squadrons and the depot.”

The success of the F-35 program at FRCE, lies with the depot’s people, Holder said, and those people will continue to push for excellence as the program grows into the future. 

“From the floor up to our leadership here, you’ve got an A-team and that’s the only reason we’ve been as successful as we have,” Holder noted. “We all take our jobs very seriously, we own them, and we do what we have to do to make sure we are successful in getting these jets back to the fleet on time.”

FRCE is North Carolina's largest maintenance, repair, overhaul and technical services provider, with more than 4,000 civilian, military and contract workers. Its annual revenue exceeds $1 billion. The depot provides service to the fleet while functioning as an integral part of the greater U.S. Navy; Naval Air Systems Command; and Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers.",2021/7/15,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/401096/frce-marks-100th-f-35-induction,"CHERRY POINT, NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],CHERRY POINT，北卡罗来纳州，美国,FRCE标志着第100个F-35感应发动机,舰队准备中心东部（FRCE）标志着其支持F-35 Lightning II计划的一个里程碑，该基地于6月11日启用了其第100架F-35进行改装。FRCE指挥官Thomas a.Atkinson上校说，这次入职不仅仅意味着一个数字――它代表了八年来在基地建立和发展F-35改装线的努力。阿特金森说：“我们非常自豪能够支持F-35平台并实现这一重要里程碑。”。“F-35的维修概念与我们在其他平台上看到的不同。我们在这100架喷气式飞机上的经验使我们的指挥能力更强，我们期待着随着更多F-35的部署，继续做出我们的贡献。”FRCE F-35分公司负责人艾克・雷滕梅尔（Ike Rettenmair）说：“只有通过飞机维修团队的努力和承诺，基地才能实现这一里程碑。自第一次入职以来，该团队已经走过了漫长的道路，是我所参与的最敬业的团队之一。”。“该平台面临着与大多数其他平台不同的挑战，团队将迎头赶上。FRCE百分之百地支持合作努力，使F-35计划取得成功。尽管我们只是企业中的一块蛋糕，但我们为向作战人员提供能力强、质量高的飞机而感到自豪。”F-35联合项目办公室FRCE现场负责人马特・克里斯普（Matt Crisp）表示，除了标志着一个里程碑外，第100次F-35入职培训还将成为该项目在基地未来发展的踏脚石。F-35部件的额外工作量、新的提升风扇设施以及F-35飞机生产线的扩容都即将出现。“这不是终点线，”克里斯普说。“在这一点上，我们正在加快步伐。我们已经走了很长一段路，对于FRC East以及在这里工作、居住、依靠该计划养家糊口的人们来说，未来的前景是美好的。我们地区有很多真正美好的事物。”雷滕梅尔说，他也期待着看到该节目继续发展。“虽然100是一个伟大的里程碑，但支持F-35还有很多年，”他说。“我参加F-35项目的时间很短，但我仍在努力；然而，没过多久，我就意识到这是一支特殊的团队，我很高兴能够帮助领导未来。我希望我仍能在这里看到我们第200架飞机的入职培训以及以后的培训，因为FRCE继续以自豪、团队精神和团队精神迎接任务d――有时――令人沮丧，而且始终安全且有质量。”FRCE的F-35联合项目办公室入职经理珍妮・霍尔德（Jeanie Holder）说，FRCE在仅有八个月的时间为工作量做准备后，于2013年7月对其首架F-35飞机进行了改装。尽管时间紧迫，该设施仍能如期投入其第一架F-35B短起飞垂直着陆变型，并在其余两种飞机变型上证明了其能力：F-35C航母变型和F-35A常规起飞和着陆变型。霍尔德说：“为了使这个基地足以支持第五代喷气式飞机，我们进行了大量的实际工作和不知疲倦的工作，当时，我们在这里还不习惯这样做。”。“对我们来说，击打100架飞机是一项巨大的成就，它表明了我们的共同努力。这不仅仅是FRC东部或F-35联合项目办公室或洛克希德马丁公司――这是一项真正的团队努力。”F-35线大修和维修主管艾伦・威廉姆森（Allen Williamson）指出，随着关键利益相关者之间关系的发展和加强，团队的努力提高了项目的效率。威廉姆森指出：“我们的许多政府和行业伙伴关系已经发展壮大，我们正在得到这些伙伴的认可，以便能够尽快扭转这些飞机的局面。”。“我们已经开放并听取了洛克希德・马丁公司和联合项目办公室的建议，当我们遇到一个问题时，我们现在有一个整合的团队来解决这个问题，并找出一条对我们所有人都有效的前进道路。我想我们在这方面真的取得了成功。”约瑟夫・西蒙兹，一位自八年前第一次入职以来就一直参与该项目的F-35机身工作负责人表示，这种团队合作帮助该项目在效率方面取得了长足进步。“我们做得更好，做得更快，”西蒙兹说。“许多程序都变得更加顺利，因为，就像其他任何程序一样，我们刚开始时有很多未知因素。多年来，一切都逐渐趋于一致，程序也因此变得更好。现在就像是，这是你需要做的所有工作，所以要做好。”威廉姆森补充说，虽然该计划一直在提高效率和加强合作关系，但改装飞机的员工在知识方面取得了进步，这有助于他们快速、胜任地解决可能出现的任何新飞机问题。他说：“我们仍然不断遇到新的障碍，但团队合作已经让我们进入了第100次入职，并将使我们远远超越这些障碍。”。“当我们需要帮助时，我们知道该去哪里，谁能帮助我们，我们毫不迟疑地去那里。”威廉姆森继续说，“我们的机械师在100架喷气式飞机上积累的知识太棒了。”。“令人惊讶的是，他们能够利用在这些飞机上工作、拆卸和组装过程中积累的知识对这些飞机进行故障排除，并且能够及时发现问题。”Crisp说，自F-35项目首次入职以来，工匠们的设施、技能和知识以及强大的合作伙伴关系促进了F-35项目的发展，为未来的成功奠定了基础。他说：“当你想到八年前我们从何而来，在这里划出一条底线，然后展望未来，这是非常了不起的。”。“在这八年中，我们不仅增加了码头空间和人员；我们还开发了每一个支持后勤要素，将工具放置到位，使生产车间能够运转和执行，并在我们的工作中变得更好、更快和更强。“我们说的是100架飞机――这意味着几十万小时的人工、工程和后勤支持，就在经过FRC East的飞机上，更不用说快速反应小组、基地现场小组和重量与平衡小组前往舰队提供协助了。我们说的是零件制造、faci我们改善了基础设施和基础设施，建立了这些关系；这些对于我们达到现在的水平以及未来的发展都是至关重要的。”随着F-35计划在基地的持续发展，Crisp表示，他预计关键支持要素将进一步发展。例如，FRCE在2020年宣布了多个F-35部件的能力，这意味着FRCE现在是这些部件的经验证的维修和测试来源，并有望在今年宣布更多部件一个计划于今年破土动工的升降机风扇设施将为FRCE提供世界上仅有的两个能够为该系统提供服务的站点之一，F-35计划计划扩大FRCE可同时容纳的飞机数量。克里斯普说：“FRC East不仅对美国海军陆战队至关重要，而且对我们所有采购F-35B飞机的国际合作伙伴也至关重要，其中有多架。”。“我们未来需要大量的工作、大量的工作和大量的体力劳动，这非常令人兴奋。然后，当你展望三到五年后，我们将开始拥有现役的F-35中队，这些中队将抵达Cherry Point――我们将能够沿着街道走到depl的整个飞行线霍尔德说，F-35计划在FRCE的成功取决于该基地的人员，随着该计划在未来的发展，这些人员将继续努力追求卓越。霍尔德说：“从地面到我们的领导层，你们拥有一支一流的团队，这是我们取得如此成功的唯一原因。我们都非常认真地对待自己的工作，我们拥有这些工作，我们做我们必须做的事情，以确保我们能够成功地将这些飞机按时运回舰队。”FRCE是北卡罗来纳州最大的维护、维修、大修和技术服务提供商，拥有4000多名文职、军事和合同工。其年收入超过10亿美元。该基地为舰队提供服务，同时作为大美国海军、海军航空系统司令部和舰队指挥官的组成部分准备中心。
5,F-35- Logistics at the speed of Lightning II,"CRYSTAL CITY, VA. (May 26, 2021) U.S. Navy Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Uy believes the F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office (F-35 JPO) is a place where employees can do great things because their work serves a higher purpose. As the F-35 JPO's Japan Foreign Military Sales In-Country Liaison Officer in Tokyo, Japan, Uy wears many hats. He is the Supply Chain Lead, Customs Clearance Officer, and Assistant Contracting Officer Representative for the Technology Security Support Team. Uy credits a former job assignment in preparing him for the culture at the F-35 JPO.

“During my second deployment to Afghanistan in 2016, I wore multiple hats as the Branch Chief for the Contracting Enabler Cell. I developed extensive skills and experience in learning how to stay calm, focused, prioritize and deescalate situations, and find creative ways to make things work. The transferable experience from Afghanistan helped me become confident, more effective, and efficient in my current job as a Customs Clearance Officer,"" Uy said.

Uy's arrival to F-35 JPO came through a connection made while serving in Afghanistan. “I met a fellow service member who would later go on to serve at the F-35 Program Office. We remained in contact following this time, and he reached out later to say there was a great job at F-35, and I was interested in going there,"" said Uy.

Uy reported in May 2019 and quickly grew accustomed to traveling back and forth between Tokyo and Washington D.C., then the COVID-19 pandemic's onset locked him down in Japan. 

“The initial lockdown and store closures was like a scene from the movie I Am Legend, but I had to go to work every day in person to fulfill our team’s part of the F-35 mission,” commented Uy.

Although physically separated from his teammates for over a year, Uy notes that it was a positive experience due to the supportive leadership of the Japan Foreign Military Sales team. ""The leadership team facilitates open communication lines, encourages collaboration efforts, and exhibits a strong sense of commitment. Everyone on the team shares the same clear and important vision, serving the best interests of the F-35 organization as a whole, and is passionately dedicated to the mission,” said Uy, who made sure he is available to his team as much as possible even when hindered by the significant time difference.

Uy's job at the F-35 JPO requires him to be precise, meticulous, and patient. “Being an F-35 Supply Chain Officer and Customs Clearance Officer means I make sure the parts clear customs on time, and what the shippers declare on the customs form is indeed what they have described,"" said Uy. ""A detailed review of their descriptions is required because as these parts clear customs, they are not opened and are not subject to customs inspection. Everything on the forms needs to be precise, the weight, the dimensions, signatures, and final destination of these parts.""

The parts clearing customs in Japan are import and export shipments originating from and to global locations. The job entails problem-solving and requires excellent interpersonal skills, dealing with various shipping agents. 

The materials in the shipments are essential to the assembly and maintenance of F-35s. ""We have factories in Japan that assemble the F135 engines, we have the Nagoya Final Assembly and Check-Out facility that builds the F-35 itself, and we get parts coming in for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force,"" said Uy. ""A costly work stoppage can happen if a part doesn't come in or it is delayed in customs. My position is essential to keeping the assembly lines flowing.""

The challenges within his role exist because ""the target usually moves,"" and the teams must be prepared to adopt new procedures. 

“We have a new initiative with the Defense Logistics Agency and the U.S. Transportation Command, global asset management of parts will change and impact my role as the Customs Clearance Officer. This initiative will see the Transportation Management Officers take over some of the functions we carry out,"" said Uy. ""To prep for that, we all participate in global asset management testing, or sending parts to different locations and guaranteeing that the process is followed with the right forms and correct clearances.” 

Uy has no doubt that the people, the culture, and the mission purpose contribute to the uniqueness of the JPO C and being inclusive will only refine it. “When you have a wide array of talents, we learn from one another and raise each other to a higher standard, and that boosts retention. Sharing each other's cultures celebrates the diversity of thought, perspectives, and backgrounds,” said Uy. “It is like the recipe for a gourmet meal. A diversity of ingredients makes the final result even better than its individual parts.""",2021/5/26,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/397447/f-35-logistics-speed-lightning-ii,"ARLINGTON, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州阿灵顿,F-35-闪电速度下的后勤II,弗吉尼亚州水晶城（2021年5月26日）美国海军少校Glenn Uy认为F-35 Lightning II联合项目办公室（F-35 JPO）是员工可以做大事的地方，因为他们的工作有更高的目的。作为F-35 JPO在日本东京的日本对外军售联络官，Uy身兼数职。他是技术安全支持团队的供应链负责人、清关官和助理合同官代表。Uy将其为F-35 JPO的文化做准备归功于之前的工作任务。“在2016年我第二次部署到阿富汗期间，我担任合同启用单元的分支主管。我在学习如何保持冷静、专注、确定优先顺序和减少情况方面积累了丰富的技能和经验，并找到了创造性的方法使事情顺利进行。来自阿富汗的可转移经验对我有所帮助在我目前的清关官员工作中变得自信、更有效、更高效，”Uy说。Uy来到F-35 JPO是通过在阿富汗服役期间建立的联系。“我遇到了一位同事，他后来在F-35项目办公室工作。我们在这之后一直保持联系，他后来说F-35有一份很棒的工作，我有兴趣去那里。”said Uy.Uy于2019年5月报道，并很快习惯于在东京和华盛顿特区之间来回旅行，然后新冠病毒-19大流行的爆发将他锁定在日本。“最初的封锁和商店关闭就像电影《我是传奇》中的一幕，但我不得不每天亲自去工作，以完成我们团队在F-35任务中的一部分。”Uy评论道。虽然与队友身体上分离了一年多，但Uy指出，这是一次积极的经历，得益于日本对外军事销售团队的支持性领导。“领导团队促进开放的沟通渠道，鼓励合作努力，并表现出强烈的承诺感。团队中的每个人都有着相同的清晰而重要的愿景，服务于整个F-35组织的最佳利益，并热情地献身于使命。”乌伊说，他确保自己尽可能多地为团队服务，即使受到明显时差的阻碍。乌伊在F-35 JPO的工作要求他精确、细致和耐心。“作为一名F-35供应链官员和清关官员，意味着我确保零件按时清关，托运人在报关单上申报的内容确实是他们所描述的，”Uy说需要对其说明进行详细审查，因为这些零件在清关时不会打开，也不会接受海关检查。表格上的所有内容都需要精确，包括重量、尺寸、签名和这些零件的最终目的地。“在日本清关的零件是从全球各地进口和出口的货物。这项工作需要解决问题，并需要优秀的人际交往技巧，与各种货运代理打交道。货物中的材料对F-35的组装和维护至关重要。“我们在日本有工厂组装F135发动机，我们有名古屋总装和检查设施，自行建造F-35，我们还为日本航空自卫队提供零件，”Uy说如果一个零件没有进货或在海关被耽搁，可能会发生代价高昂的停工。我的职位对于保持装配线的正常运转至关重要。“他职责范围内的挑战是存在的，因为“目标通常会移动”，团队必须准备采用新的程序。Uy说：“我们与国防后勤局和美国运输司令部有一项新计划，零件的全球资产管理将改变并影响我作为清关官员的角色。这项计划将使运输管理官员接管我们执行的一些职能。”。“为了做好准备，我们都参与了全球资产管理测试，或将零件发送到不同的地点，并确保流程得到正确的表格和正确的许可。”Uy毫不怀疑，人民、文化和使命目标有助于JPO的独特性――而包容性只会使其更加完善。乌伊说：“当你拥有各种各样的人才时，我们会互相学习，提高彼此的水平，这会提高记忆力。分享彼此的文化可以庆祝思想、观点和背景的多样性。”。“这就像是一顿美餐的食谱。不同的配料使得最终的结果比单独的部分还要好。”
6,MARCENT Commander meets with F-35 Squadron,"MACDILL AIR FORCE BASE, Florida C Last week, Lieutenant General Carl Mundy III, Commander of Marine Corps Forces, Central Command, met with Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron 501 (VMFAT-501), an F-35B squadron from 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing conducting training on MacDill Air Force Base.

The 2nd MAW training squadron, based out of Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina, trained for two weeks on MacDill executing simulated missions varying from close air support, to air-to-air combat operations.

“MacDill’s aviation ranges, and the Florida weather this time of year allows squadrons like ours to increase our operational tempo, and significantly benefits our student pilots and aircraft maintainers,” said VMFAT-501 commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Paul Holst.

Lieutenant General Mundy’s visit to MacDill’s flight line follows his most recent travel to the Central Command area of operations, during which he met with Marines from several different units currently deployed to the region. Among those Lt. Gen. Mundy visited was the Aviation Combat Element of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which employs F-35Bs.

“Some of these instructors have over 10 years of experience on the F-35B platform,” said Master Gunnery Sgt. Huber, VMFAT-501 maintenance chief, “but even in teaching student pilots and mechanics through advanced-level training operations, every Marine aviator is constantly maintaining, and expanding its proficiency on the aircraft.”

The F-35B is a 5th generation fighter, and has revolutionized air operations across the U.S. Armed Forces since the Marine Corps’ declaration of initial operating capability in 2015. In deploying units to different training environments the pilots and maintainers refine their abilities to not only efficiently utilize the complex systems of the F-35B, but fluidly react and implement them in diverse scenarios. The training conducted in VMFAT-501 will ready Marine aviators, as well as one pilot from the Australian Armed Forces, on the F-35B to operate in expeditionary environments, like that of the Aviation Combat Element on 15th MEU while deployed to the 5th Fleet in Central Command.

Lieutenant General Mundy and the Marines of VMFAT-501 discussed the significant technological advancements in the F-35B and the military advantage it brings to U.S. Central Command.

MARCENT provides Marine Expeditionary Forces capable of conducting a wide range of operations, offering Central Command a responsive and unique set of capabilities.

8,An inside look at F-35 pilot helmet fittings,"HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah -- Reservists in the 419th Operations Support Squadron play a crucial role to ensure the safety of pilots assigned to the 419th Fighter Wing, the Air Force Reserve’s only combat-capable F-35 unit.  

“We are responsible for maintaining and repairing pilot gear to ensure everything is in proper working condition,” said Staff Sgt. AJ Arteaga, aircrew flight equipment reservist with the 419th OSS. “That also includes their helmet.”

Every helmet is custom-fitted to its pilot during a two-day process at a fit facility. To begin assembly of the helmet, pilots have their heads measured and scanned to secure the perfect fit. 

Once assembled, pilots need to have the optics aligned using a pupilometer, which measures the distance between their pupils within two millimeters of its center, so pilots see a single image on the helmet-mounted display.

On the display, pilots are able to view mission-critical information and obtain enhanced situational awareness of the battlefield simply by moving their head. The helmet gives pilots a 360-degree view of the F-35’s external environment without needing to tip the jet.

“The pilot can look down through a portion of their wing and see what’s below,” said Tech. Sgt. William Vass, 419th OSS. “When they look toward the cameras embedded on the F-35, that image projects onto their helmet display.”

The helmet’s innovative technology and precise fit require routine maintenance so pilots can complete their mission. In addition to pre- and post-flight fittings, the helmet is inspected every 105 days and has a 120-day fit check to ensure its functionality and safety.

“Pilots come in and put on all their gear so we can double-check to make sure everything fits properly and without issue,” Arteaga said. “Small things such as a new haircut or a couple of pounds gained could cause the helmet to not fit correctly.” 

Mask adjustments are also included within the helmet fitting. Pilots are sent to an oxygen tester where aircrew flight equipment technicians can identify any leaks around the mask that could prevent adequate oxygen flow.

“The next part is to ensure there is a proper distance between the mask and the visor,” Arteaga said.  “We have to make sure when the pilot moves or talks, the mask doesn’t hit the visor. If it’s too close, it will bend the visor and distort the display image.”

Reservists in the AFE shop are an integral part of helmet fitting process and maintenance intervals. They verify it remains as precise as possible to guarantee the safety of the 27 pilots in the 419th FW. The work is involved and in-depth, but essential to providing a seamless interaction between the helmets’ advanced capabilities and the exacting skills of the pilot wearing it.",2021/7/10,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/402764/inside-look-f-35-pilot-helmet-fittings,"UT, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国犹他州,F-35飞行员头盔配件的内部观察,犹他州希尔空军基地――419作战支援中队的预备役人员在确保419战斗机联队飞行员的安全方面发挥着至关重要的作用，419战斗机联队是美国空军预备役部队中唯一具有战斗能力的F-35部队。“我们负责维护和修理飞行员装备，以确保一切都处于正常的工作状态，”419 OSS机组飞行设备预备役中士AJ Arteaga说。“这也包括他们的头盔。”每一个头盔都是在一个fit设施的为期两天的过程中为飞行员定制的。在开始装配头盔时，飞行员要对头部进行测量和扫描，以确保完美贴合。一旦装配完成，飞行员需要使用瞳孔计校准光学元件，瞳孔计测量瞳孔中心两毫米范围内瞳孔之间的距离，以便飞行员在头盔显示器上看到单个图像。在显示器上，飞行员只需移动头部，就可以查看关键任务信息并增强战场态势感知。该头盔让飞行员可以360度地看到F-35的外部环境，而无需倾斜喷气机。“飞行员可以通过机翼的一部分向下看，看到下面是什么，”第419 OSS技术中士威廉・瓦斯（William Vass）说。“当他们看着嵌入F-35的摄像头时，图像会投射到头盔显示器上。”头盔的创新技术和精确配合需要日常维护，以便飞行员能够完成任务。除了飞行前和飞行后的装备外，头盔每105天检查一次，并进行120天的安装检查，以确保其功能和安全。“飞行员进来并穿上他们所有的装备，以便我们可以再次检查，以确保所有装备都正确无误地安装，”Arteaga说。“小事情，如新发型或体重增加几磅，可能会导致头盔无法正确安装。”头盔安装中还包括面罩调整。飞行员被送往氧气测试仪，在那里，机组飞行设备技术人员可以识别面罩周围可能阻止氧气充分流动的任何泄漏。“下一步是确保面罩和面罩之间有适当的距离，”阿尔泰加说。“我们必须确保当飞行员移动或说话时，面罩不会碰到面罩。如果太近，面罩会弯曲面罩并扭曲显示图像。”AFE车间的预备役人员是头盔安装过程和维护间隔的一个组成部分。他们证实它尽可能精确，以保证419 FW中27名飞行员的安全。这项工作涉及面广且深入，但对于在头盔的先进性能和佩戴头盔的飞行员的严格技能之间提供无缝交互至关重要。

Every helmet is custom-fitted to its pilot during a two-day process at a fit facility. To begin assembly of the helmet, pilots have their heads measured and scanned to secure the perfect fit. 

Once assembled, pilots need to have the optics aligned using a pupilometer, which measures the distance between their pupils within two millimeters of its center, so pilots see a single image on the helmet-mounted display.

On the display, pilots are able to view mission-critical information and obtain enhanced situational awareness of the battlefield simply by moving their head. The helmet gives pilots a 360-degree view of the F-35’s external environment without needing to tip the jet.

“The pilot can look down through a portion of their wing and see what’s below,” said Tech. Sgt. William Vass, 419th OSS. “When they look toward the cameras embedded on the F-35, that image projects onto their helmet display.”

The helmet’s innovative technology and precise fit require routine maintenance so pilots can complete their mission. In addition to pre- and post-flight fittings, the helmet is inspected every 105 days and has a 120-day fit check to ensure its functionality and safety.

“Pilots come in and put on all their gear so we can double-check to make sure everything fits properly and without issue,” Arteaga said. “Small things such as a new haircut or a couple of pounds gained could cause the helmet to not fit correctly.” 

Mask adjustments are also included within the helmet fitting. Pilots are sent to an oxygen tester where aircrew flight equipment technicians can identify any leaks around the mask that could prevent adequate oxygen flow.

“The next part is to ensure there is a proper distance between the mask and the visor,” Arteaga said.  “We have to make sure when the pilot moves or talks, the mask doesn’t hit the visor. If it’s too close, it will bend the visor and distort the display image.”

Reservists in the AFE shop are an integral part of helmet fitting process and maintenance intervals. They verify it remains as precise as possible to guarantee the safety of the 27 pilots in the 419th FW. The work is involved and in-depth, but essential to providing a seamless interaction between the helmets’ advanced capabilities and the exacting skills of the pilot wearing it.",2021/7/10,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/402495/inside-look-f-35-pilot-helmet-fittings,"UT, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国犹他州,F-35飞行员头盔配件的内部观察,犹他州希尔空军基地――419作战支援中队的预备役人员在确保419战斗机联队飞行员的安全方面发挥着至关重要的作用，419战斗机联队是美国空军预备役部队中唯一具有战斗能力的F-35部队。“我们负责维护和修理飞行员装备，以确保一切都处于正常的工作状态，”419 OSS机组飞行设备预备役中士AJ Arteaga说。“这也包括他们的头盔。”每一个头盔都是在一个fit设施的为期两天的过程中为飞行员定制的。在开始装配头盔时，飞行员要对头部进行测量和扫描，以确保完美贴合。一旦装配完成，飞行员需要使用瞳孔计校准光学元件，瞳孔计测量瞳孔中心两毫米范围内瞳孔之间的距离，以便飞行员在头盔显示器上看到单个图像。在显示器上，飞行员只需移动头部，就可以查看关键任务信息并增强战场态势感知。该头盔让飞行员可以360度地看到F-35的外部环境，而无需倾斜喷气机。“飞行员可以通过机翼的一部分向下看，看到下面是什么，”第419 OSS技术中士威廉・瓦斯（William Vass）说。“当他们看着嵌入F-35的摄像头时，图像会投射到头盔显示器上。”头盔的创新技术和精确配合需要日常维护，以便飞行员能够完成任务。除了飞行前和飞行后的装备外，头盔每105天检查一次，并进行120天的安装检查，以确保其功能和安全。“飞行员进来并穿上他们所有的装备，以便我们可以再次检查，以确保所有装备都正确无误地安装，”Arteaga说。“小事情，如新发型或体重增加几磅，可能会导致头盔无法正确安装。”头盔安装中还包括面罩调整。飞行员被送往氧气测试仪，在那里，机组飞行设备技术人员可以识别面罩周围可能阻止氧气充分流动的任何泄漏。“下一步是确保面罩和面罩之间有适当的距离，”阿尔泰加说。“我们必须确保当飞行员移动或说话时，面罩不会碰到面罩。如果太近，面罩会弯曲面罩并扭曲显示图像。”AFE车间的预备役人员是头盔安装过程和维护间隔的一个组成部分。他们证实它尽可能精确，以保证419 FW中27名飞行员的安全。这项工作涉及面广且深入，但对于在头盔的先进性能和佩戴头盔的飞行员的严格技能之间提供无缝交互至关重要。
10,First Danish F-35s land at Luke AFB,"LUKE AIR FORCE BASE, Ariz. C Royal Danish Air Force pilots delivered the first two RDAF F-35A Lightning II fighter jets to Luke Air Force Base, April 13, 2021, in preparation of pilot training.

The aircraft, assigned to the 308th Fighter Squadron will eventually be joined by five other Danish F-35s for use in the F-35 training program. According to the U.S. State Department, as stalwart NATO allies, the United States and Denmark cooperate extensively to promote peace and stability internationally.

“Today is a historical day for the partnership of the U.S. and Denmark,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Matt “HAIL” Cisar, 308th FS commander. “We’ve been preparing for the first Danish jets for years. Now that they’re here, we’re excited to train our first Danish fighter pilots.”

Pilots from all around the world participate in the F-35 training program. Royal Danish Air Force Lt. Col. Nick “KIN” Hansen, 308th FS senior national representative, mentions the importance of building relationships between allied countries.

“We have to be able to operate together with different nations in the fifth generation Air Force,” said KIN. “When we have to go in to fight war together, we find comfort knowing we’ve gone through training from the same place.”

Luke is currently training fighter pilots from many countries such as Italy, Netherlands, Norway, and Singapore. 

“It's truly remarkable to come into a fighter squadron in which a U.S. pilot might fly a Danish jet alongside a Dutch pilot flying a U.S. jet,” said Cisar. “It shows all the work that's gone into the F-35 program, the partnerships and how much we rely on each other to get the mission done.”

The F-35 training program is designed to integrate pilots, foreign and domestic, into a common set of tactics and advanced technologies enabling them to execute the mission as one unit.",2021/4/13,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/394759/first-danish-f-35s-land-luke-afb,"LUKE AFB, AZ, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国亚利桑那州卢克空军基地,第一架丹麦F-35在卢克空军基地着陆,亚利桑那州卢克空军基地――2021年4月13日，丹麦皇家空军飞行员向卢克空军基地交付了首批两架RDAF F-35A Lightning II战斗机，为飞行员培训做准备。分配给308战斗机中队的这架飞机最终将与另外五架丹麦F-35战斗机一起用于F-35培训计划。据美国国务院称，作为北约的坚定盟友，美国和丹麦在促进国际和平与稳定方面进行了广泛合作。第308空军司令、美国空军中校马特・西萨尔（Matt“HAIL”Cisar）说：“今天是美国和丹麦结成伙伴关系的历史性日子。”。“我们多年来一直在为第一架丹麦战斗机做准备。现在他们来到这里，我们很高兴能训练我们的第一架丹麦战斗机飞行员。”来自世界各地的飞行员参加了F-35训练计划。第308届FS高级国家代表、丹麦皇家空军中校Nick“KIN”Hansen提到了在盟国之间建立关系的重要性。“我们必须能够在第五代空军中与不同国家一起作战，”KIN说。卢克目前正在训练来自意大利、荷兰、挪威和新加坡等许多国家的战斗机飞行员。西萨尔说：“进入一个战斗机中队，一名美国飞行员可能驾驶一架丹麦飞机，而另一名荷兰飞行员则驾驶一架美国飞机，这真是了不起。”。“它展示了F-35计划中的所有工作、合作伙伴关系以及我们在完成任务方面相互依赖的程度。”F-35训练计划旨在将国内外飞行员整合到一套通用战术和先进技术中，使他们能够作为一个整体执行任务。

12,F-35 Demo Team meets F135 Engine Team,"Members of the F-35A Lightning II Demonstration Team visited Tinker Air Force Base to meet and thank the men and women of the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex Heavy Maintenance Center for their work on the F135 engine that powers their aircraft.

The May 25, 2021, visit featured an F-35 aerial demonstration and static display, allowing the maintainers to personally see the aircraft up close and their engine in action; a first for many HMC employees.

“The commander of Air Combat Command [Gen. Mark Kelly] said he wanted to do something to motivate the forces that are powering the F-35,” said Brig. Gen. Jeff King, Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex commander. “This demonstration was all about them and the work they do for the United States and our warfighters.”

ACC directed the demo team visit to Tinker AFB as a show of appreciation for the men and women who perform depot-level maintenance on the F-35’s engine (the Pratt & Whitney F135) and related components.

The visit began with a familiarization briefing and a tour of the engine production line. The demo team ground crew was excited to meet the depot maintainers, and used the opportunity to discuss maintenance techniques. News that new, more advanced, borescopes, a flexible camera used to inspect internal engine components, would soon be headed to the field was well received.

Approximately 300 people gathered outside Bldg. 3001 in the afternoon to watch the Hill AFB, Utah-based F-35 perform aerobatic maneuvers that demonstrated its abilities as a 5th-generation fighter. Prior to the demonstration, maintainers and enterprise partners were able to get up close and explore a static display aircraft.

“This is exciting, this was the first time I’ve seen an F-35 up close,” said Troy Petty, a 544th Propulsion Maintenance Squadron senior inspector, who earlier in the day demonstrated the new borescope technology.

Petty also spoke about the importance of the demo for his team, noting that some of the members of his shop have never been close to an F-35.

The demonstration flight was initially delayed by weather but conditions allowed for a lower altitude, faster demonstration. This gave viewers on the ground better views of the jet, accentuated by vapor cones, visible clouds of condensed water created by aircraft flying through moist air at high speeds.

The F-35 completed high speed passes and tight turns, wowing the crowd. The slow speed pass, completed at 100 knots or 115 mph, demonstrated how slowly the F-35 can maintain level flight at a high angle of attack without stalling, due in large part to the powerful F135 engine.

After the demonstration, F-35 Demo pilot Maj. Kristin “Beo” Wolfe and the rest of the demo team met with the maintainers, thanking them for their work sustaining the engines that keep their aircraft flying.

“I just want to say thank you from all of us in the F-35 community,” Wolfe said. “We would not be combat ready without all the hard work of the F135 engine team.”

The OC-ALC HMC is the primary repair depot for the F135 engine, performing all aspects of engine maintenance. It supports all F-35 engine variants, including models operated by Navy and Marine Corps units, as well as those of partner nations.",2021/5/25,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/399576/f-35-demo-team-meets-f135-engine-team,UNITED STATES,[],[],美国,F-35演示团队与F135发动机团队会面,F-35A Lightning II演示团队的成员参观了Tinker空军基地，会见并感谢俄克拉荷马市航空物流综合体重型维修中心的男男女女，感谢他们在为飞机提供动力的F135发动机方面所做的工作。2021年5月25日的参观包括F-35空中演示和静态展示，允许维修人员亲自近距离观察飞机及其发动机的运行情况；这是许多HMC员工的第一次。布里格说：“空战司令部司令（马克・凯利将军）说，他想做些什么来激励为F-35提供动力的部队。”。杰夫・金将军，俄克拉荷马州城市航空物流中心指挥官。“这次演示是关于他们以及他们为美国和我们的作战人员所做的工作。”ACC指导演示团队访问Tinker空军基地，以表示对在F-35发动机（普惠F135）上执行基地级维修的男男女女的感谢参观开始于熟悉情况介绍和参观发动机生产线。演示团队地勤人员很高兴见到基地级维修人员，并借此机会讨论维修技术。新的、更先进的内窥镜，一种用于检查发动机内部部件的柔性摄像机，很快将被派往现场，这一消息广受欢迎。大约300人下午聚集在3001号大楼外观看希尔空军基地，总部位于犹他州的F-35进行特技飞行，展示了其作为第五代战斗机的能力。在演示之前，维修人员和企业合作伙伴能够近距离探索静态显示飞机。“这很令人兴奋，这是我第一次近距离看到F-35，”第544推进维修中队高级检查员特洛伊・佩蒂说，佩蒂在当天早些时候演示了新的内视镜技术。佩蒂还谈到了演示对他的团队的重要性，他指出，他的车间的一些成员从未接近过F-35。演示飞行最初因天气原因推迟，但条件允许进行低空、快速的演示。这让地面观众更好地看到了喷气式飞机，尤其是蒸汽锥，飞机在潮湿空气中高速飞行时产生的可见凝结水云。F-35完成了高速飞行和急转弯，让观众大吃一惊。低速飞行以100节或115英里/小时的速度完成，演示了F-35在大迎角下保持水平飞行而不失速的速度，这在很大程度上归功于强大的F135发动机。演示结束后，F-35演示飞行员克里斯汀・沃尔夫少校和演示团队的其他成员会见了维修人员，感谢他们为维持飞机飞行所做的工作。“我只想对F-35社区的所有人说声谢谢，”沃尔夫说。“如果没有F135发动机团队的辛勤工作，我们将无法做好战斗准备。”OC-ALC HMC是F135发动机的主要维修基地，负责发动机的各个方面维护。它支持所有F-35发动机型号，包括由海军和海军陆战队部队以及伙伴国家操作的型号。
13,F-35 RRT meets maintenance needs in dual deployments,"MARINE CORPS AIR STATION CHERRY POINT, N.C. C Aircraft maintenance professionals with Fleet Readiness Center East’s F-35 Rapid Response Team play a critical role in keeping the Marine Corps’ F-35B Lightning II fleet healthy.  

In support of this goal, FRCE’s F-35 Rapid Response Team (RRT) recently conducted simultaneous deployments to Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona, and aboard the USS Makin Island, underway in the Arabian Sea. RRT maintainers inspected and repaired 12 F-35B aircraft, all in under 40 days C including travel, precautionary restriction of movement and workdays. 

“The F-35 Rapid Response Team is a strategic asset within our Navy-Marine Corps team, and I couldn’t be more proud of the drive and dedication these individuals display with every mission,” said FRCE Commanding Officer Capt. Mark E. Nieto. “They’re ready to pack up and ship out to anywhere in the world at a moment’s notice and, when they arrive, they get to work and stay on task until the job is done. The RRT plays a vital role in aviation readiness, and you won’t find a finer crew of maintainers anywhere in the armed forces.”

The RRT consists of expert artisans cross-trained in multiple maintenance trades to ensure efficiency and flexibility. Having team members with multiple skill sets allows for a flexible configuration, which means the team can pick and choose which artisans to deploy to a mission based on what the technical requirements will be. 

The RRT arrives on-site with skill sets and tools that aren’t normally required for repairs at the squadron level or on a ship, said Maj. Randy Brazile, F-35B Detachment maintenance officer for Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 164 (Reinforced), 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, aboard the Makin Island. 

“The FRCE RRT was called to the USS Makin Island to execute repairs to the 15th MEU’s F-35s, with specialized tools that are not resident in a fleet F-35 squadron,” Brazile said. “They are very experienced artisans and possess qualifications that are not frequently required by operational squadrons. This combination of qualifications, tooling, and the ability to rapidly deploy worldwide provides a valuable resource to the fleet forces when specialized repairs are required.”

The team arrived quickly and showed up ready to perform and share their knowledge with the Marines aboard the Makin Island, Brazile added. 

“The RRT deployed in under 48 hours and arrived on ship eager to work,” he said. “The team worked very closely with the Marines of VMM-164 (Rein.) and RRT took every opportunity to teach and instruct the younger Marines.”

Having these repairs conducted on site, rather than having to send the aircraft to intermediate- or depot-level facilities for modifications helps reduce downtime for the aircraft, and get them back in the air as quickly as possible. 

“The ability of the RRT to execute repairs on ship allowed the 15th MEU and Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group to continue operations while the aircraft repairs were ongoing,” Brazile explained. “The 15th MEU F-35s continued flying combat sorties in support of the U.S. Central Command Area of Responsibility simultaneously to the RRT repairs. Overall, this was an excellent demonstration of the Naval Aviation Enterprise reacting to unexpected maintenance requirements while maintaining operational capability for the combatant commander.”

Reducing aircraft-on-ground time is especially important for forward-deployed units like VMM-164 (Rein.) and units scheduled for deployment, including Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 211 at MCAS Yuma.

Ike Rettenmair, F-35 branch head at FRCE, said the RRT provides a strategic capability in supporting F-35B readiness throughout the Marine Corps; however, the team doesn’t work alone. The F-35 Fleet Support Team provides critical support to the RRT. This team includes engineering, logistics and program management across both government and contractor agencies and is a key player in the success of the deployments. While much of the support team’s work is done in the background, these elements coordinated seamlessly with the RRT to ensure delivery of technical instructions, tooling and consumable supplies were staged and ready for use once the team arrived on site. 

“While the team was deployed, many government and contractor support groups were constantly working behind the scenes to be certain the forward-deployed teams were successful,” Rettenmair said. “The FST led daily phone conferences were held to keep all parties up to speed and informed of the needs of the team. From the moment we got the notice of need, it was all hands on deck for our F-35 modification team, the F-35 FST, the F-35 Joint Program Office, FRCE support equipment engineering and logistics, logistics management and Naval Aviation Logistics Command. 

“We deployed to two separate locations within 10 days of each other,” he continued. “Once we received notice of the need, the support team had less than 48 hours to work through the logistics of getting our artisans and the tooling to the USS Makin Island, including everything from COVID testing and orders to securing a military flight and gathering tools and consumables. It was truly a team effort.”

The RRT maintainers’ skill and passion for service, supported by the FST’s logistics and engineering capabilities, set the team apart in terms of what they can accomplish in challenging environments, Rettenmair said. 

“I had full confidence in what these artisans could do when given the opportunity to show not only the warfighter in need, but also the world what makes FRCE unique,” he said. “They performed very well under sometimes-less-than-ideal conditions, and proved again what a critical capability the RRT provides. 

“While most of the team was comprised of regular RRT-designated members, there were a few on each team who don’t normally work RRT missions but are trained and seasoned professionals, and were willing to volunteer in support of our warfighters,” Rettenmair added. “The majority of these artisan are military veterans, which gives them even more pride in what they do C they have been on the other side, and understand the need for support firsthand. And while the deployments were a team effort, these artisans deserve most of the credit for the events’ success.”

Matthew Crisp, F-35 Joint Program Office site lead at FRCE, said experience from previous missions has given the RRT a firm foundation to build upon, and that know-how paid dividends with these deployments.  

“This isn’t the first time the RRT has been deployed for unscheduled F-35 repairs and it most certainly will not be the last,” he explained. “We are fortunate to have had opportunities in the past for the RRT to come to the support of the fleet on less time sensitive and critical repairs which were good to ‘sharpen our pencils’ before this event. 

“This evolution certainly flexed the RRT and Fleet Support Team’s speed and agility to a new level and clearly showed the value that the team has,” Crisp continued. “This success has set the bar higher than ever for the RRT and support team and the collective team will continue to fill this much needed role across the F-35 program for years.”

Every event provides a learning opportunity, Rettenmair noted, that will help improve the team’s performance in the future.

“There are lessons learned and we will gather notes, brainstorm and make the next effort even better for all parties involved,” he said. “It all leads to FRCE and the RRT being better able, and always willing, to support the U.S. warfighter at any time, anywhere in the world.”

“As a depot maintenance trainer, the airframe will allow new employees an opportunity to test their skills on the proper maintenance and repair processes used on F-35 before being required to do it on a fleet aircraft,” said Matt Crisp, FRCE site lead for the F-35 Joint Program Office. “Our sustainment engineering efforts include the ability to prototype modifications and repairs, test new and improve existing support equipment, test new processes and materials, and support other efforts to investigate opportunities for sustainment cost and maintainability improvements.” 

The relocation process began March 1, when workers at MCAS Beaufort prepped the airframe and used a crane to load it onto the barge, which took four days to reach MCAS Cherry Point via the Intracoastal Waterway. At the MCAS Cherry Point docks, transportation specialists unloaded the airframe from the barge and used a self-propelled transport dolly to transport the airframe to FRCE during the night. Officials scheduled the unusual delivery method to Cherry Point and late-night transfer to FRCE to make the lowest possible impact along the transportation route. 

“The decision to move the airframe with a barge was largely due to the expected impacts of traffic along the route from Beaufort to Cherry Point,” said Crisp. “I can tell you that it gained a lot of attention as it made its way through the Intracoastal Waterway.

“We’re excited to have this airframe available because it allows us to train our workforce and test new engineering sustainment initiatives without impacting a fleet aircraft,” said Crisp. “It will only make us better prepared to support fleet readiness.“

FRCE is North Carolina's largest maintenance, repair, overhaul and technical services provider, with more than 4,000 civilian, military and contract workers. Its annual revenue exceeds $1 billion.

15,"F-35, Cavour sea trials also test logistics","NORFOLK NAVAL STATION, Va.― A container marked “PAX Flight Deck Gear CAVOUR DET 2021,” tri-wall boxes for the work centers, shipping containers with massive aircraft air & power units, engine trailers, and other aircraft support equipment (SE) were craned aboard, forklifted through the hangar, and positioned aboard Italian aircraft carrier ITS Cavour moored here over the last week of February.

The Italian navy flagship arrived here Feb. 13, 2021 as part of the Italian navy’s Ready for Operations (RFO) campaign to certify the recently upgraded ship’s compatibility with F-35 Lighting II aircraft and prepare to operate the 5th generation fighter as its key weapons system.

Before the arrival of the specially instrumented U.S. test jets that will be used to develop and expand a flight envelope, the special tools, parts (those required plus those possibly needed), and support equipment must be aboard and in its place. This undertaking is all in a (couple of) days’ work for F-35 Patuxent River Integrated Test Force (PAX ITF) logistics lead and his team, as well as the many who support the mission.

That effort comprises ensuring that “part of PAX” gets aboard the ship before two F-35B short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) test jets ferry from the southern Maryland naval air station to the aircraft carrier after it sets sail, said the PAX ITF logistics team supervisor.

“I love the challenge,” said F-35 PAX ITF logistics supervisor Pat DeLeon, in between a worker asking how to get a pair of leather gloves and another querying where to find the wire cutters. A day earlier he was driving a forklift on the flight deck, and tomorrow, … well, he’ll be wherever he’s needed.

For the moment, in the relative quiet before “Lightning II strikes,” there is a hum of languages, foreign and familiar, in the hangar. A look around makes it clear this is a coalition mission: “For Entry Contact … ”  and “NO SMOKING” on containers and boxes are backdropped by the ship’s “In Caso Di Necessita’” and In Questo Locale Vietato Fumare signage. This is a partnership, one Pat says has gone well so far.

“(The Cavour ship’s company) have been bending over backwards to help,” DeLeon says. “They’ve been great,” about some adjustments to the load plan, he said. Flexibility is a necessary characteristic of the relationship, he added, because there will be changes until the ship sets sail.

“’When we work together, it’s going to get better,’” DeLeon said his counterpart told him. “If we keep them happy, we’re happy.”

Mission achieved: The Cavour “hangar boss” is well pleased.

“At first glance, seeing so many people and so much material to get on this ship seemed an arduous and complex undertaking,” said Italian Navy Master Chief Petty Officer Silvio Cusano. “As the days went by and everyone collaborated, what seemed extremely complicated has materialized into an organizational success that made everyone aware of being able to overcome the most difficult obstacles.

“We are looking to the final goal with more confidence.”

It takes a team
DeLeon, a seasoned logistics supervisor who has detached to two U.S. ships, twice to the United Kingdom’s HMS Queen Elizabeth, and numerous land-based sites, praised his team of four currently embarked, which includes a night-shift supervisor and three material handlers, as well as the many organizations and teams behind what’s happening in the berthed ship.

“Without my team at PAX, none of this happens,” DeLeon said. “There’s no way I can do this by myself.” He said he coordinates with a lot of people to get this done: the PAX team, Lockheed Martin’s Fort Worth transportation, Norfolk Naval Station’s crane operators, and [ALGS] for aircraft parts.

The logistics team is part of a more robust embarked PAX ITF flight test team of almost 200 people. They will conduct sea trials for up to four weeks to collect data that will ultimately lead to the certification for Cavour’s company to safely conduct carrier operations with Italy’s own F-35Bs.",2021/2/21,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/390663/f-35-cavour-sea-trials-also-test-logistics,UNITED STATES,[],[],美国,F-35，卡沃试航也测试后勤,弗吉尼亚州诺福克海军基地――一个标有“PAX Flight Deck CAVOUR DET 2021”的集装箱、用于工作中心的三面墙箱子、装有大型飞机空气和动力装置、发动机拖车和其他飞机支持设备（SE）的运输集装箱被吊上飞机，并通过机库叉起，意大利海军旗舰于2021年2月13日抵达这里，作为意大利海军准备作战（RFO）的一部分旨在证明最近升级的战舰与F-35 Lighting II飞机的兼容性，并准备将第五代战斗机作为其关键武器系统使用。在用于开发和扩展飞行包线的专用仪器化美国测试飞机抵达之前，专用工具、部件（需要的加上可能需要的）和支持设备必须在船上并就位。这项任务是F-35帕塔克森特河综合试验部队（PAX ITF）后勤领导和他的团队以及支持任务的许多人在几天内完成的。这项工作包括确保“PAX的一部分”“在两架F-35B短距起飞和垂直着陆（STOVL）测试喷气机从马里兰南部海军航空站飞到航空母舰开航后，在它上船之前，”PAX ITF后勤团队主管说，“我喜欢这个挑战，”F-35 PAX ITF后勤主管Pat DeLeon说，一名工人询问如何获得一副皮手套，另一名工人询问在哪里可以找到钢丝钳。一天前，他在飞行甲板上驾驶叉车，明天，……好吧，他将在需要的任何地方。目前，在相对安静的前一天“闪电II来袭”，机库里充斥着外国和熟悉的语言。环顾四周，可以清楚地看出这是一项联合任务：“为了进入接触……”和“禁止吸烟”在集装箱和箱子上被船上的“在Caso Di Essentiala”返回在Questo地区，Vietato Fumare标牌。帕特说，这是一种合作关系，到目前为止进展顺利。”（Cavour船的公司）一直在竭尽全力提供帮助，”德隆说。“他们很好，”关于装载计划的一些调整，他说。灵活性是这种关系的一个必要特征，他补充说，因为在船启航之前会有变化。“当我们合作时，情况会变得更好，”德隆说，他的同事告诉他。“如果我们让他们高兴，我们就高兴。”任务完成：卡沃尔“机库老板”非常高兴。“乍一看，看到这么多人和这么多材料登上这艘船似乎是一项艰巨而复杂的任务，”意大利海军少校首席中士西尔维奥・库萨诺说。“随着日子一天天过去，每个人都在合作，看似极其复杂的事情已经变成了组织上的成功，让每个人都意识到能够克服最困难的障碍。”我们满怀信心地期待着最终的目标一名经验丰富的后勤主管teamDeLeon曾派遣两艘美国军舰，两次前往英国皇家海军伊丽莎白女王号和多个陆上基地，他赞扬了目前由四名成员组成的团队，其中包括一名夜班主管和三名物料搬运员，以及支持这一计划的许多组织和团队发生在停泊的船上。“没有我的团队在帕克斯，这一切都不会发生，”德隆说。“我不可能一个人做这件事。”他说，他与很多人协调完成这件事：帕克斯团队、洛克希德・马丁公司的沃斯堡运输公司、诺福克海军站的起重机操作员和[ALGS]对于飞机部件。后勤团队是一个由近200人组成的更强大的PAX-ITF登船飞行试验团队的一部分。他们将进行长达四周的海上试验，以收集数据，最终获得Cavour公司使用意大利自己的F-35B安全进行航母操作的认证。
16,F-35 simulator building unveiled during Winter Fury,"MARINE CORPS AIR STATION MIRAMAR, Calif. C (January 25, 2021) 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (MAW) dedicates its inaugural F-35 simulator building aboard Marine Corps Air Station Miramar January 21, 2021. This marks the next step in streamlining the training process of the fifth-generation joint strike fighter, which has been recognized as one of the most advanced aircraft in military history.

In addition to providing a much more efficient means of producing highly trained pilots to operate the fifth-generation stealth fighter, this simulator will allow 3rd MAW aviators to train, rehearse, and refine their integrated abilities alongside the Navy and other Marine Corps allies operating across the globe.

“This building coming together will train pilots to bring violence to the people that desperately need it,” said Maj. Gen. Christopher Mahoney, 3rd MAW Commanding General. “That’s what this represents, another step that forces our competitors and adversaries, whether they’re Chinese or anybody else, to think twice.”

Flight simulators are an essential tool and an integral part of Marine aviation training that allow 3rd MAW squadrons to hone critical skills in simulated environments that refine their ability to conduct operations with a variety of aviation platforms in multiple environments from a centralized location.

“Distributed mission training will have the ability to integrate with other Navy and Marine Corps assets that are off site,” said Jennifer Moore, Training and Operations Manager for Lockheed Martin. “So we’ve got the F-35 simulators here on site that we’re going to be able to link with air wing operations that Navy counterparts that they’re going to be flying with in combat, as well as integrates other Marine Corps units as well, and able to have everybody join on the same simulated environment. The Air Force has their own distributed mission training network and the next step would be to get connected and let all the services play in the same domain.”

“The building is a manifested result of the teamwork and dedication of Marines that everyone talks about,” said Mahoney. “To the team here that allows us to take another step against our adversaries, my hat’s off to you.”

3rd MAW continues to “Fix, Fly and Fight” as the Marine Corps’ largest aircraft wing, and remains combat-ready, deployable on short notice, and lethal when called into action.

17,Armament shop maintains F-35 weapons system equipment,"Luke Air Force Base, Ariz. C Airmen from the 56th Equipment Maintenance Squadron F-35A Lightning II armament shop are building a capability the Air Force may benchmark to store and maintain alternate mission equipment for the F-35’s weapons system.

While the Air Force has 17 F-35 units, only two have a similar capability, and the 56th EMS is establishing procedures for future F-35A units to employ.

The 56th Maintenance Group established the AME shop in May 2019 and, in addition to inspecting and ordering supplies including F-35 adapters, pylons and launchers. 

Alternate mission equipment is “basically, any equipment that’s needed to either launch a missile or drop a munition, or anything that deals with the gun system has to come through us,” said Staff Sgt. Peter Christopher, 56th EMS F-35 AME supervisor. “And there's quite a bit among each of the four F-35 squadrons. There are hundreds and hundreds of pieces of equipment.”

Before the Luke’s F-35 AME shop was established, F-35 aircraft maintenance personnel stored weapons equipment in hangars, warehouses and designated AME rooms. While maintenance Airmen stored the equipment in accordance with technical orders and instructions, a centralized storage facility to easily access the equipment was not available, said Christopher.

“Now there's a central point where somebody inspects and takes care of the equipment,” said Christopher.

After receiving and cataloging F-35 weapons parts, the 56th Logistics Readiness Squadron delivers the inventory to the AME shop where Airmen organize the equipment and store it in crates for future use.

“It's really a nonstop game of Tetris here,” said Christopher. “It's basically about finding the space to get in all the equipment.”

Not only is the F-35 armament shop one of few in the Air Force, it is one of the few with Airmen qualified to repair the F-35 bulk loader, an ammunition loading system that loads 25mm rounds into the F-35 GAU-22 25mm cannon’s linkless ammunition handling system.

“Every base that has F-35s currently has bulk loaders because they're used as long as they're firing the gun,” said Senior Airman Janey Sawmiller, 56th EMS F-35 maintenance supervisor. “Most bases just don't have a back shop that's working on them.”

Previously, if the bulk loaders required maintenance, maintenance Airmen sent the equipment to the manufacturing warehouse for repairs. Now all the maintenance is performed in the armament shop. Sawmiller said having maintenance in-house saves the Air Force time and money.

“I like learning something new that no one has ever done before,” said Sawmiller. “I also like the hands-on maintenance aspect.”

According to Christopher, the armament shop is creating benchmark for what a standard AME squadron should look like in the Air Force. 

“In a small capacity, we’re turning into the focal point for transfers and setups of new AME squadrons on other bases,” said Christopher. “It's not official, but we've managed to get a course of action such that allows other bases to use us as an interim for getting their new squadron set up.”

18,Royal Navy Teammate Brings Valued Engineering Skills to F-35,"CRYSTAL CITY, VA. (June 28, 2021) As part of the F-35 Enterprise you get to work with talented colleagues to advance the affordability, capability, and availability of the most lethal aircraft in the global fleet. Royal Navy Lt. Cdr. Stuart Greenfield, a British teammate who works for the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) on the F-35 Assistant Program Manager of Logistics (APML) team, was fascinated at a young age by the military, its technology, and the value of a hard-working team that serves their country.

""My dad took me to the ‘International Festival of Sea’ at the Her Majesty’s Naval Base, Portsmouth. Every few years, naval ships from all over the globe visited. We got to go on different ships from different nations. I got a flavor for how we all complete our missions differently, but the end goal is the same,” reminisced Greenfield. “I took that idea of international teamwork with me. I remember vividly going onto the flight deck on one of the U.K.'s Invincible-class aircraft carriers, seeing the Harrier, and chatting with the pilots and engineers. It was amazing to experience as a kid, and it captured my imagination and sculpted me to join the Royal Navy.""

The United Kingdom has been an integral partner since the F-35 Enterprise’s earliest days, even before the choice of a final aircraft concept. ""While we all have the same end goal, we have slightly different ways of achieving it due to our cultures and the different core values found in our militaries, but that is what works well for the F-35,"" said Greenfield, who knew he would join the Royal Navy in 2009 following his university graduation.

After various assignments, including time with Rotary-Wing support for the Commando Helicopter Force and a stint as an engineering instructor, Lt. Cdr. Greenfield arrived in California in 2017 to support F-35 Initial Operational Test & Evaluation at Edwards Air Force Base.

""I was an engineering officer and did a year out there with the F-35. I then returned to Royal Air Force Base (RAF) Marham in 2018 to support the stand-up of the 617 Squadron,"" said Greenfield. ""I was part of the engineering team that took the aircraft from Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina, where the U.K. team trained with the U.S., and stepped up F-35 operations at RAF Marham.""

Greenfield reported to the F-35 JPO in February 2019 to join the F-35B Deputy APML team. There is an APML and at least one Deputy APML for each F-35 variant, and these teams are one of the main links between the warfighter and the program office. ""On the Deputy APML team for the F-35B, it is a U.S. Marine Corps Major and me. The APML reports directly to the Product Support Manager, allowing us to have holistic oversight of sustainment across the JPO. Our primary focus is ensuring we meet the Warfighter's needs from a sustainment perspective,"" said Greenfield.

Greenfield discovered that when he came to the JPO, even with ten years of military experience, he had to learn new aspects of the program since it was an unfamiliar environment. He worried if his lack of acquisition experience would hinder his performance at the JPO.

""From my perspective, I had no acquisition background. My career thus far had been operationally focused. I was used to working on a small team that is at the end of a chain delivering an output,"" Greenfield said. ""However, that is also the rewarding part of being here. It is building those diverse relationships across the program, across multiple disciplines, and also with both government and industry partners.""

""It was a great entry to the JPO's U.K. team and Deputy APML role. My U.S. teammates welcomed me, and if it weren't for them, my learning curve would have been greater. I worked on F-35 squadrons for two years before the JPO, so I knew F-35, but I didn't know acquisition, I didn't understand the U.S. way of doing acquisition or how a U.S. program office worked, but my U.S. teammates were there for me and were very helpful with getting me acclimated,” said Greenfield. “Equally, I was the only one on our team who had experience on an F-35 squadron and had maintained the air system. It tied in with the fact that everyone has a unique skill that elevates the quality of your team here.""

The learning curve at the JPO allowed Greenfield to realize that making mistakes means pushing boundaries and putting yourself outside of your comfort zone.

""It is easy to sit back and not put yourself out there and not ask the stupid questions, but, I learned we have to embrace the fact that we work in a complicated program where you need to ask those questions. If you don't put yourself out there, successful or innovative ideas won't just appear,"" Greenfield determined.

The F-35 is currently demonstrating its interoperability aboard the Royal Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth (R08), and Lt. Cdr. Greenfield thinks that is both exciting and significant for the program.

""The milestone deployment is great! I joined the Navy in 2009, and our last operational carrier deployment with fixed-wing aircraft was in 2010. To see the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force operating on HMS Queen Elizabeth is very exciting. And to do it with U.S. Marines is a testament to the strong relationship between our two countries and the [F-35] B variant operators,"" said Greenfield. ""We trained with the Marines at Beaufort, and to now be deployed at sea with them is fantastic. It shows the great benefits of this program and the interoperability of the F-35. We can deploy on a partner nation's aircraft carrier. I'm jealous of anyone that gets to sail with the Queen Elizabeth for the next couple of months!""

19,Laser Shock Peening - life-extending technology at work in F-35,"CRYSTAL CITY, Va. (APRIL 5, 2021) The F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) teamed up with engineers at U.S. Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE) in Cherry Point, North Carolina, and laser technology professionals to strengthen the airframe of the U.S. Marine Corps short take-off-vertical landing (STOVL) F-35B. In February 2021, the first F-35B was inducted at the FRCE to receive the procedure, known as laser shock peening, to enable the aircraft to reach its full structural life limit. Although not every F-35B requires this modification, there are enough aircraft to keep the new facility hard at work, reinforcing additional F-35B airframes.

""The first F-35B that completed the laser shock peening procedure is a huge milestone for the F-35 Program and culminates three months of hard work and continuous learning,"" said F-35 JPO Vehicle Systems Director Alex Stathopoulos. ""The teams at the JPO and at the Fleet Readiness Center East now can offer a strategic capability to the U.S. Marine Corps and other F-35B variant customers that is only available today at FRCE. A second laser shock peening site will stand up later this year at Ogden Air Logistics Center, Utah. Only two sites are planned to support F-35 laser shock peening modification efforts worldwide.""

Laser shock peening is a high-tech procedure that uses high-energy laser beams to strengthen materials on the aircraft's bulkhead and airframe without adding additional metal or weight to increase aircraft lifespan and reduce maintenance costs. The technique has built on the experience of more than 20 years of use on commercial aircraft components and military aircraft such as the F-22 and, most recently, the F-35.

High-energy laser beams are fired at the metal, and laser shock waves penetrate deep into metal surfaces to create residual stress patterns to counteract corrosion, cracking, and other symptoms of metal fatigue. Ultimately, it leads to a more durable airframe. Upon completion, the FRC-E will put the F-35Bs back together, perform all the flight test functions and get them back to the fleet.

""By strengthening the airframe with this advanced laser procedure, it keeps the F-35 flying because these solid structures remove critical life limits on the aircraft while not adding additional weight, allowing full fuel or weapons carrying capacity,"" explained Col. Michael Dehner, F-35 U.S. Marine Corps Service Deputy at the JPO. ""The technology protects the warfighter and boosts our nation's defense by ensuring aircraft are ready for operational employment when called upon.""

The additional safety and structural life that laser shock peening provides also allows the F-35, particularly the F-35B, to be more supportable, more affordable, and more lethal. F-35Bs are currently flying missions from deployed amphibious ships with the U.S. Marine Corps, certifying the ability to fly off the flight deck of ITS Cavour (Italian navy ship, CVH 550) while also training U.S. and allied nation pilots and maintainers to be ready to support and defend our nation's freedom.

The F-35 JPO comprises more than 2,000 uniformed, civilian, and contractor personnel, distributed across more than 40 locations around the world. The program provides fifth-generation weapons system technology in support of air combat missions for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, seven F-35 cooperative partner nations, and a growing number of foreign military sales (FMS) customers. The F-35 JPO has delivered the F-35 aircraft in partnership with industry partners and a diverse team of subordinate suppliers. To date, more than 620 F-35s have been delivered, over 368,000 safe flying hours have been accumulated, and over 1,270 pilots and 10,150 maintainers have been trained.

20,International Business interest pursued at the F-35 Joint Program Office,"ARLINGTON, Va. (March 22, 2021) -- Mehvish Khan accepted a Contract Specialist position at the F-35 Lightning II Joint Program Office (JPO) in 2019 while embarking on her post-graduate life. The challenge of pursuing her Master's Degree at Georgetown University in Security Studies and supporting the JPO's Contracts Department's mission is indicative of the hard-charging individuals at the JPO.

The Lakewood, New York native, was attracted to the program's international business side after an internship at the U.S. Embassy in London. While working on their political-military affairs team, she learned the importance of allied nations and how to work closely with others to develop innovative ideas; precisely the experience Khan would need to hit the ground running at the JPO.

""When I arrived at the JPO, I supported modification contracts for the F-35 aircraft, working with the Engineering Team. It is interesting because you put ideas to paper, solidify them, and make those ideas come to life,” said Khan. “Your actions have real-world implications on the lives of our military. As part of the contracts team, you are part of the implementation and execution of ideas. You then see these capabilities delivered, and that is the rewarding part."" 

As Khan approached her second anniversary at the JPO, she realized that she had been given an opportunity to be a part of something bigger. She started seeking ways to support Foreign Military Sales (FMS) contracts for Israel and the Republic of Korea. Her energetic attitude and drive got her noticed and opened the door to a permanent FMS team position. 

""I was drawn by the news of a possible new customer for the F-35, and I asked if I could support it on the contract side. Showing my interest allowed me to do something inspiring and support FMS full-time,"" said Khan. ""You have to dive into everything and be curious here. The more immersed you are, the better you will be in the long run.""

Being proactive is the key to success at the JPO, according to Khan. 

Her advice to those starting their careers following college is to make your own way. ""Do not be afraid to ask questions or ask for new opportunities; be the steward of your own career,"" Khan said.

Even though the JPO is divided into different Project Management Offices and Functional Teams, all those supporting F-35 warfighters agree: it is a full-team effort. ""The mission doesn't work if everyone doesn't do their part,"" Khan added. The commitment to create an inclusive environment where we invite and encourage diverse perspectives, ideas, and people is essential for longevity. This inclusive approach allows us to remain competitive and innovative―now and in the future. ""With diversity comes different perspectives and life experiences,"" said Khan. A variety of perspectives is vital to any organization. ""When you get a group of unique human beings together from which to draw ideas, you are going to get the best final idea.""

Khan's perspective and positivity are a model for both newcomers and seasoned members of the F-35 JPO.

21,TF-76 conducts a Staff Exercise,"WESTOVER, Mass. C The Task Force 76 (TF-76) out of Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts, held its staff exercise or STAFFEX, Aug. 3-7.
The exercise is task organized between the senior leaders and various staff sections for briefings, battle rhythm, drills, rehearsals, staff estimate, and working group sessions designed to train the unit for its wartime missions.
 “How do we run estimate for the unit, into our SOPs?  How we do rehearsal, we need to understand and incorporate that into our SOP,” said Col Doug Mills, TF-76 chief of staff.  
One of the tasks to staff is to create sectional structure in accordance with 150 passengers battle roster and to identify key outputs and staffing shortfalls.  “The end of STAFFEX, the staff should give and back brief the chief of staff, and say sir, we looked at what we got, we looked at our resources, this is the structure that we want to use; it meets the commander’s intent, these are the titles and positions,” said Maj. Thomas Gingras, TF-76 operations officer.
Mills referenced his battle update brief (BUB) during his deployment, how the brief was at seven every morning because the North BUB was at eight in the morning.  “You have to be flexible and adaptable and be able to do those kinds of things.  That is why identifying these duties and responsibilities, and what you’re bringing to me, at least the ones that are standing, boards and working groups, allows that flexibility. It allows us to fill that bench players and the people that we pull in on short notice to fill those gaps.”
The STAFFEX group sessions included briefings from Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), Joint Task Force C Civil Support (JTF-CS), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Bonnie Roy, Regional Planner at MEMA, provided an overview of the Web Emergency Operations Center (EOC).  The Soldiers were provided a multi-user account that will be the account that the Soldiers will take with them.  So if they activate their EOC and they want to use Web EOC, this will be the permanent login and password, from now and going forward.  “Web EOC is our primary communication tools and it operates 24/7 for our dispatch, if it’s actually for disasters, it moves over into the state EOC.  We also use it here in regional EOC,” said Roy.
MEMA is the state agency responsible for coordinating federal, state, local, voluntary and private resources during emergencies and disasters in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
Information Management Officer Bill Solar, JTF-CS, said that the Web EOC is a web-based database use to share information over the internet.  “It’s an emergency management tool.  We use it as our main emergency operations tool.”  During hands-on, Soldiers learned that the web-based also managed situational awareness activity log by being able to record, track and share information where everyone can see.  They are able to input after action review (AAR), update briefing slides for the command update brief, update personnel status (Red Cross, leave) and protocol biographies for distinguish visitors, built-in checklist (ex: aircraft accident), flight tracker for TF-Aviation, and request for information (RFI) tracker.  These are some of the boards examples created in the database.  The web-based also managed resource requests such as generators, chainsaw, tents, spill kits, and more during major incidents and disasters.
“Web EOC basically lets you know what’s going on in the state,” said Roy.
“EOC is a new system.  We do this to increase awareness.  How do you link that into your staff estimate,” said Mills.
The TF-76 leadership plans to use the knowledge gained and the work accomplished during STAFFEX to prepare for future exercises and missions.
The TF-76’s mission is to deploy to provide mission command to Department of Defense response forces, conducting operations in a Command and Control Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear Response Element C A (U.S. Army) role, and anticipates requirements in support of civil authorities, to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain public confidence.",2016/8/5,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/206448/tf-76-conducts-staff-exercise,"WESTOVER AIR FORCE BASE, MA, UNITED STATES",[],[],威斯托弗空军基地，马萨诸塞州，美国,TF-76进行人员训练,马萨诸塞州威斯托弗8月3日至7日，马萨诸塞州Westover空军储备基地的第76特遣部队（TF-76）举行了员工演习或STAFFEX。该演习由高级领导和各员工部门组织，内容包括简报、战斗节奏、演习、彩排、员工评估、，以及为训练部队执行战时任务而设计的工作组会议。TF-76参谋长道格・米尔斯上校说：“我们如何在SOP中对部队进行评估？我们如何进行排练，我们需要了解并将其纳入SOP。”。工作人员的任务之一是根据150名乘客的战斗名册建立部门结构，并确定关键产出和人员短缺。托马斯・金格拉斯少校说：“斯塔夫克斯结束后，参谋部应该向参谋长汇报情况，并说，长官，我们看了我们得到的东西，我们看了我们的资源，这是我们想要使用的结构；它符合指挥官的意图，这些是头衔和职位。”，TF-76作战官。米尔斯在部署期间参考了他的作战更新简报（BUB），简报是如何在每天早上七点进行的，因为北部BUB是在早上八点进行的。“你必须具有灵活性和适应能力，能够做这类事情。这就是为什么确定这些职责和责任，以及你给我带来的东西，至少是那些站着的、董事会和工作组，允许这种灵活性。它允许我们填补替补球员和我们在短时间内吸引的人。”STAFFEX小组会议包括来自马萨诸塞州应急管理局（MEMA）、民事支持联合工作队（JTF-CS）和联邦应急管理局（FEMA）的简报。MEMA的区域规划师Bonnie Roy概述了网络应急运营中心（EOC）。士兵们被提供了一个多用户帐户，这将是士兵们随身携带的帐户。因此，如果他们激活自己的EOC，并希望使用Web EOC，那么从现在起，这将是永久登录名和密码。“网络平等机会委员会是我们的主要通信工具，它为我们的调度提供24/7的服务，如果它真的用于灾难，它将转移到州平等机会委员会。我们在地区平等机会委员会中也使用它，”罗伊说。MEMA是负责协调联邦、州、地方，马萨诸塞州联邦紧急情况和灾难期间的自愿和私人资源。JTF-CS信息管理官比尔・索拉（Bill Solar）表示，网络平等机会委员会是一个基于网络的数据库，用于在互联网上共享信息。“这是一种应急管理工具。我们将其用作主要的应急操作工具。”在实践中，士兵们了解到，基于web的系统还可以通过记录、跟踪和共享每个人都能看到的信息来管理态势感知活动日志。他们能够输入行动后回顾（AAR）、更新指挥更新简报的简报幻灯片、更新人员状态（红十字会、休假）和访客的协议传记、内置检查表（例如：飞机事故）、TF航空飞行跟踪器和信息请求（RFI）跟踪器。这些是在数据库中创建的一些板示例。在重大事故和灾难期间，基于网络的EOC还管理发电机、电锯、帐篷、泄漏工具包等资源请求。“网络EOC基本上让你知道该州发生了什么，”罗伊说。“EOC是一个新系统。我们这样做是为了提高意识。你如何将其与员工评估联系起来？”TF-76领导层计划利用在STAFFEX期间获得的知识和完成的工作，为未来的演习和任务做好准备。TF-76的任务是部署，为国防部反应部队提供任务指挥，在指挥和控制化学、生物、放射性、，核反应要素――一种（美国陆军）角色，预测支持民政当局的需求，以拯救生命、减轻痛苦和维持公众信心。
22,Task Force 76 trains for the ‘what if’,"CAMP ATTERBURY, Ind.C When catastrophes like hurricane Katrina hit the U.S., most Americans understand that the Federal Emergency Management Agent (FEMA) will arrive on the scene almost immediately to take the lead in the federal response. What most people don’t know is that there are three federal task forces that exist specifically designed to step in to support. The three military task forces are TF-76, TF-38 and Joint TF- Civil Support. 
Exercise Vibrant Response is a command post exercise that simulates the task force response to a nuclear detonation in a major U.S. city. The exercise is like a role playing game where participants interact with one another. This trains people to learn what to do from the good and bad decisions they make. So that if the situation ever does happen they will make the right decision.
“Task Force 76’s mission is to support the lead federal agency, and is one of three federal task forces that are set up for all-hazards response,” said Maj. Gen. Ricky Waddell, commander of Task Force 76, based out of Salt Lake City. “With special capabilities for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear response, and our composition includes specialists in the “C-B-R-N” fields, but we have a variety of other support personnel. 
A total of about 570 service members from several branches of the military have taken part in the exercise. 
Key to the exercise is replicating complex scenarios the task force may face in responding to a real-world event. 
“This exercise is the culminating training event that we do to prepare the staff to deal with the chaotic conditions in an urban disaster environment,” said Col. Doug Mills, the Chief of Staff for Task Force 76. “We try to replicate those requirements that our civilian agencies are going to ask of us and work through coordination events so we can provide them on-time support.” 
Examples of the challenges thrown at task force during the exercise range from getting supplies and food to areas where roads and infrastructure have been destroyed to having nuclear experts track projected plume of nuclear fallout and the identify effects of exposure at different levels and times to dealing with a helicopter crash. The issues often come up at a moment’s notice and require efficient coordination and teamwork. 
Having the ability to practice with the other units in advance of a real world event is critically important, Mills said. “The worst thing that can happen to us is that we’re exchanging business cards on the ‘battlefield’ and during that time of crisis. We need to be able to trust and depend on the people who have the knowledge and expertise. So this is how we stay ready.”",2016/5/14,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/198641/task-force-76-trains-if,"CAMP ATTERBURY, IN, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国阿拉巴马州阿特伯里营地,第76工作队为“假设”进行培训,印第安纳州阿特伯里营地――当卡特里娜飓风等灾难袭击美国时，大多数美国人都明白，联邦应急管理局（FEMA）几乎会立即赶到现场，带头采取联邦应对措施。大多数人不知道的是，有三个联邦特别工作组专门为支持这一计划而成立。三支军事特遣部队分别是TF-76、TF-38和联合TF-民事支援。演习Vibrant Response是一次指挥所演习，模拟特遣部队对美国主要城市核爆炸的反应。这个练习就像一个角色扮演游戏，参与者之间相互交流。这训练人们从他们做出的好的和坏的决定中学习该做什么。因此，如果情况真的发生，他们将做出正确的决定。“76号工作队的任务是支持主要的联邦机构，是为应对所有危险而成立的三个联邦工作队之一，”位于盐湖城的76号工作队指挥官Ricky Waddell少将说。“具有化学、生物、辐射和核反应的特殊能力，我们的组成包括“C-B-R-N”方面的专家”但我们有各种各样的其他支持人员。来自多个军种的总共约570名军人参加了演习。演习的关键是复制特遣部队在应对现实事件时可能面临的复杂场景。76号工作队参谋长道格・米尔斯上校说：“这次演习是我们为准备工作人员应对城市灾害环境中的混乱状况而进行的最重要的培训活动。”。“我们试图复制我们的民事机构将向我们提出的要求，并通过协调活动开展工作，以便我们能够及时向他们提供支持。”演习期间，工作队面临的挑战包括从获得补给和食品到道路和基础设施被破坏的地区，到让核专家跟踪预计的核沉降物羽流，以及确定不同程度和不同时间的暴露对处理直升机坠毁的影响米尔斯说，在一个现实世界的活动之前，有能力与其他单位一起练习是至关重要的。“可能发生在我们身上的最糟糕的事情是，我们在‘战场’上和危机期间交换名片。我们需要能够信任和依赖拥有知识和专业技能的人。因此，这就是我们如何做好准备的方式。”
23,76 Years Later- Remembering Pfc. Nelles,"JOINT BASE PEARL HARBOR-HICKAM, Hawaii―When the Japanese attacked Hickam Field on Sunday, December 7, 1941, over 189 people lost their lives.  One in particular was a young chaplain’s assistant who was setting up for the morning service.  Seventy-six years later, a small group gathered in the Courtyard of Heroes for a remembrance service and Catholic Mass in honor of U.S. Army Air Corps Pfc. Joseph Nelles Dec. 10. 

“This is a sacred place today―not just because we gather to pray and worship; it’s also sacred because we gather to remember,” said Lt. Col. David Dersch, Pacific Air Forces staff chaplain. “Whatever our faith background, we share a common legacy of faith and courage.  Today, we are ohana―brought together by an amazing heritage.”

Nelles was a Catholic chaplain’s assistant stationed at Hickam Field in 1941. He was preparing the altar for Mass at the base theater that Sunday when a bomb hit.  The theater was completely destroyed and Nelles’ body was found at the altar. 

In a letter to Nelles’ parents, Col. Edmund C. Sliney, the base chaplain, wrote about their son’s dedication to both God and country.

24,TF-76 prepares to save lives and mitigate the suffering,"CAMP ATTERBURY, Ind. -- When disaster strikes and chaos sets in, people can forget their cities' emergency evacuation plans and highways get stacked with traffic. People get hurt and communication gets cut off.  

Vibrant Response 17 is an annual command post exercise here that simulates the detonation of a nuclear bomb in a major city within the United States. This year it was integrated with Guardian Response 17 at Muscatatuck Urban Training Center, Indiana.

The exercises enable emergency response organizations, both civilian and military, to integrate and provide relief during a catastrophic disaster.

The simulated detonation occurred May 2, 2017. Following the established national response framework, the state first responders and National Guard forces answered the first calls for help.

As the situation escalated and resources were exhausted, the state requested federal support. Per the federal response framework, the first federal agencies to respond are civilian. Support from the Department of Defense is then requested as necessary. Task Force 76  arrived at the scene on May 6, 2017.

Once at the scene, TF-76 provides support to the incident commander, state and Federal Emergency Management Agency in several areas. These include:  urban search and rescue, extractions, and mass casualty decontamination. They also have transportation assets that allow them to do patient evacuation and resupply both by ground and air. They have the ability to produce water and have operational, medical and logistical forces. The task force is made up of people assigned to the 76th Operational Readiness Command, a U.S. Army Reserve unit out of Salt Lake City.

Brig. Gen. James Blakenhorn, the deputy commanding general for TF-76, said the task force gains two main things out of this training event. First, it exercises the higher staffs to ensure they have processes, procedures, interfaces and communications established and ready to execute.  Secondly, it gives the folks in the field at GR17 confidence in their abilities to perform the mission. It also provides units with the confidence in their equipment, procedures and leadership to become more proficient.

During a catastrophic event such as VR17, FEMA is the primary agency requesting support from TF-76 and another task force, TF-46, the Michigan National Guard’s 46th Military Police Command.

According to Master Sgt. Trevor Smith, the future operations noncommissioned officer in charge for TF-76, FEMA can send down specific mission requests, or MAs, for support such as supplies, transportation and decontamination said. Following that initial request, the headquarters for TF-76 or TF-46 have to develop plans of action. They do this through battle rhythm briefings that then provide the information to create updated fragmentary orders. Once each task force knows their mission, they disseminate orders down to the commanders on the ground. 

These and other processes require time and practice to perfect. Training together prepares everyone for when it’s time to react to a real-world scenario, where the mission is to save lives and mitigate the suffering of the people of the United States.

“We always plan this exercise as if the worst had happened, however, what's great about our mission is that it doesn't have to be a nuclear detonation for us to get involved,” said Blakenhorn. “The catastrophe could be something like a hurricane or a wild fire. There's a number of natural disasters that can cause a great deal of pain and suffering where federal forces may be required.

“Due to the experience the Soldiers get here at this level, they also know they can perform if they were called up for some of these other missions as well,” added Blakenhorn. “We hope that we never have to use these assets, but if we do, we want the Soldiers to know, through these type of exercises, that they are fully capable of performing the mission at call.”",2017/5/7,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/233033/tf-76-prepares-save-lives-and-mitigate-suffering,"CAMP ATTERBURY, IN, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国阿拉巴马州阿特伯里营地,TF-76准备拯救生命和减轻痛苦,印第安纳州阿特伯里营地――当灾难来袭和混乱来临时，人们可能会忘记他们城市的紧急疏散计划，高速公路上塞满了车辆。人们受到伤害，交流中断。Vibrant Response 17是这里一年一度的指挥所演习，模拟美国一个主要城市的核弹爆炸。今年，它在印第安纳州马斯卡塔塔克城市培训中心与《卫报》第17号响应系统整合。演习使民间和军方的应急响应组织能够在灾难性灾难期间整合并提供救援。模拟爆炸发生在2017年5月2日。根据建立的国家反应框架，州第一反应者和国民警卫队部队响应了第一批求助电话。随着局势升级和资源耗尽，州请求联邦支持。根据联邦反应框架，第一批作出反应的联邦机构是民间机构。必要时请求国防部提供支持。第76特遣部队于2017年5月6日抵达现场。一旦到达现场，TF-76将在多个地区向事件指挥官、州和联邦应急管理局提供支持。这些措施包括：城市搜救、撤离和大规模伤亡人员净化。他们还拥有运输设备，可以通过地面和空中进行患者后送和再补给。他们有能力生产水，并拥有作战、医疗和后勤力量。该特遣部队由分配到第76作战准备司令部的人员组成，该司令部是盐湖城以外的美国陆军预备役部队。TF-76的副指挥官詹姆斯・布莱克霍恩将军说，特遣部队从这次训练活动中获得了两大收获。首先，它训练高层员工确保他们建立了流程、程序、接口和通信，并准备好执行。其次，它让GR17现场的人员对他们执行任务的能力充满信心。它还让部队对自己的装备、程序和领导能力充满信心，从而变得更加熟练。在VR17这样的灾难性事件中，联邦应急管理局是请求TF-76和另一个特遣部队TF-46（密歇根州国民警卫队第46军警司令部）支持的主要机构。据特雷弗・史密斯上士说，联邦应急管理局负责TF-76的未来作战士官可以发送具体任务请求，或MAs，以获得补给、运输和去污等支持。根据这一初步要求，TF-76或TF-46总部必须制定行动计划。他们通过作战节奏简报做到这一点，然后提供信息以创建更新的零碎订单。一旦每个特遣部队了解了他们的任务，他们就会向地面指挥官下达命令。这些和其他过程需要时间和实践来完善。共同训练让每个人都做好准备，以应对现实世界的情况，在现实世界中，任务是拯救生命和减轻美国人民的痛苦。Blakenhorn说：“我们总是把这次演习当作最糟糕的情况发生一样来计划，然而，我们的任务最大的好处是，我们参与演习不一定非得是核爆炸。”。“这场灾难可能是飓风或野火。在需要联邦军队的地方，有许多自然灾害可能会造成巨大的痛苦和痛苦。布拉肯霍恩补充道：“由于士兵们在这一级别上的经验，他们也知道，如果他们也被征召参加其他一些任务，他们也能胜任。”。“我们希望我们永远不必使用这些资产，但如果我们这样做，我们希望士兵们通过这些类型的演习知道，他们完全有能力执行随时待命的任务。”
25,45th SW supports successful Falcon 9 NROL-76 launch,"SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket is carrying a classified national security payload for the U.S. National Reconnaissance Office. This will be SpaceX’s first launch for the NRO.

This launch marked the third launch to use the Autonomous Flight Safety System and the fourth successful landing of the Falcon 9 first stage booster on SpaceX’s Landing Zone 1 at CCAFS. AFSS takes ground-based mission flight control personnel and equipment out of the control center and replaces it with on-board Positioning, Navigation and Timing sources and decision logic.  The benefits of AFSS include increased public safety, reduced reliance on range infrastructure, reduced range spacelift cost, increased schedule predictability and availability, operational flexibility, and launch site flexibility.

The Falcon 9 NROL-76 launch was the seventh major launch operation for the Eastern Range this year. Before any launch can blast off from the range, a dedicated team of military, government civilians and contractors from across the wing provide the mission assurance to ensure a safe and successful lift-off for range customers.

“Assured access to space is a team sport here on the Eastern Range.""

""We continue to play a vital role in assuring access to space and this launch demonstrates our capability to keep up the pace as we move closer to our goal of 48 launches a year,” said Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, 45th Space Wing commander.  “It takes less than a minute to get a rocket safely out of our atmosphere, but this launch was the culmination of many long hours and preparation though a series of rigorous rehearsals, readiness reviews and pre-operational checkouts.  This mission once again clearly demonstrates the successful collaboration we have with our mission partners at NRO and SpaceX as we continue to shape the future of America’s space operations and showcase why the 45th Space Wing is the ‘World's Premiere Gateway to Space.’”",2017/5/1,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/232115/45th-sw-supports-successful-falcon-9-nrol-76-launch,"CAPE CANAVERAL AIR FORCE STATION, FL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佛罗里达州卡纳维拉尔角空军基地,第45软件支持Falcon 9 NROL-76成功发射,SpaceX的猎鹰9号火箭为美国国家侦察局携带一枚国家安全机密有效载荷。这将是SpaceX首次为NRO发射。这次发射标志着第三次使用自主飞行安全系统发射，以及Falcon 9一级助推器第四次成功着陆在SpaceX的着陆区1 CCAFS。AFSS将地面任务飞行控制人员和设备带出控制中心，代之以机载定位、导航和定时源以及决策逻辑。AFSS的好处包括提高公共安全性、减少对靶场基础设施的依赖、降低靶场空间提升成本、增加计划的可预测性和可用性、操作灵活性和发射场的灵活性。猎鹰9号NROL-76发射是今年东部靶场的第七次主要发射操作。在任何发射可以从靶场发射之前，一支由军方、政府文职人员和整个机翼的承包商组成的专门团队提供任务保障，以确保靶场客户安全成功地发射。“确保进入太空是东区的一项团队运动。”我们在确保进入太空方面继续发挥着至关重要的作用，这次发射表明我们有能力跟上步伐，因为我们正朝着每年48次发射的目标迈进，”布里格说。韦恩・蒙提斯将军，第45空间联队指挥官。“火箭安全离开大气层只需不到一分钟的时间，但这次发射是经过一系列严格的排练、准备就绪审查和运行前检查的长时间准备工作的高潮。这次任务再次清楚地表明，我们与我们的任务伙伴在NRO和SpaceX将继续塑造美国空间运营的未来，并展示为什么第45太空翼是“世界首屈一指的太空门户”
26,"ARNORTH, TF 76, others wrap up virtual annual disaster response exercise","SAN ANTONIO, Texas C U.S. Army North, U.S. Northern Command’s Joint Force Land Component Command, Task Force 76 and 750 military and civilian personnel from across the country participated in Vibrant Response, an annual disaster response training exercise, Apr. 26 to May 8, through virtual collaborative software.
 
“The purpose of Vibrant Response is to prepare a command and control headquarters to command and control a response in support of simulated chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) events,” said Col. Scotty Lene, the Vibrant Response Commander Operations Group (COG), for U.S. Army North. 

Task Force 76, the headquarters being evaluated, is a deployable reserve component element that, when activated, provides command and control of military response forces in support of civilian responders to manage catastrophic CBRN incidents.
 
“We’ve really watched this unit evolve over the last couple of years,” said Lene. “We gave them a rigorous problem set, they stepped up to the challenge, and then performed exceptionally.”

Vibrant Response 21 involved participants from the Department of Defense, Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other military and civilian agencies across the United States.
 
“This headquarters, along with its two-sister headquarters, one in the National Guard, and the other in the active component; all three responded in support of COVID last year,” explained Lene. 
 
These types of exercises help ensure they are ready to take on disasters of this magnitude, Lene said.

“They performed exceptionally in the [COVID-19] response,” said Lene. 
 
While Vibrant Response is a virtual exercise, it provides realistic training to every echelon of the formation. 
 
“It’s real life, they make it as real as they can get here. Nothing fake about it, which, I think this is really good training,” said Spc. Kimberly Soto, a human resources specialist with the 338th Medical Brigade, 3rd Medical Command Deployment Support, supporting the simulation team for Vibrant Response 21.

Realistic training lends itself to real world success and Task Force 76 has applied those training lessons over the years. 

 “Everything we do is in support of things that are happening in America, whether it's hurricane response, disaster response, wildland firefighting… pretty much everything happened in 2020, we were there, and that's a great mission to be able to give back to the American population.” said Lene.",2021/5/8,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/397256/arnorth-tf-76-others-wrap-up-virtual-annual-disaster-response-exercise,"SAN ANTONIO, TX, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国德克萨斯州圣安东尼奥,76号特遣部队的阿诺思和其他人完成了虚拟年度救灾演习,德克萨斯州圣安东尼奥―美国陆军北部司令部、美国北部司令部联合部队陆上部分司令部、76号特遣部队以及来自全国各地的750名军事和文职人员通过虚拟协作软件参加了4月26日至5月8日举行的年度灾难响应训练演习。“振动响应的目的是准备一个指挥和控制总部，指挥和控制响应，以支持模拟化学、生物、辐射和核（CBRN）事件，”振动响应指挥官行动小组（COG）Scotty Lene上校说76特遣部队总部正在评估中，是一个可部署的预备役部队组成部分，一旦启动，将提供军事反应部队的指挥和控制，以支持民事反应人员管理灾难性CBRN事件。“我们真的看到了这个部队在过去几年的发展。”莱恩说：“我们给了他们一套严格的问题集，他们接受了挑战，然后表现得异常出色。”来自国防部、联邦应急管理局以及美国其他军事和民用机构的参与者参与了21项充满活力的响应。“这个司令部，连同它的两个姐妹司令部，一个在国民警卫队，另一个在现役部队；去年这三个司令部都响应支持新冠病毒，”莱恩解释说。莱恩说，这些类型的演习有助于确保他们准备好应对如此规模的灾难。“他们在[新冠病毒-19]中表现出色。”“反应，”莱恩说。虽然“活力反应”是一种虚拟训练，但它为编队的每个梯队提供了逼真的训练。“这是真实的生活，他们尽可能做到真实。没有任何虚假之处，我认为这是一种非常好的训练。”Spc.Kimberly Soto说，他是第三医疗司令部第338医疗旅部署支持部门的人力资源专家，支持模拟团队实现活力应对21。现实训练有助于现实世界的成功，76号工作队多年来一直在应用这些训练课程。“我们所做的一切都是为了支持美国正在发生的事情，无论是飓风应对、灾难应对、荒地灭火……几乎所有事情都发生在2020年，我们都在那里，这是一项伟大的使命，能够回报美国人民。”莱恩说。

28,Grissom Marines help return World War II Marine home after 76 years,"From the shores of the Gilbert Islands to home in Marion, Indiana, Marine Private Fred Freet’s journey took 76 years. The the final stretch was aided by Marines from Grissom Air Reserve Base, Indiana.

A Marine Corps honor guard from Grissom participated in the dignified transfer of Marine Corps Pvt. Fred Freet, 18, of Marion, Indiana, at the Indianapolis International Airport April 16.

Freet was killed in action during World War II, and initially declared by the military as unrecoverable killed in action until Aug. 6, 2018 when the U.S. Navy positively identified his remains.

“From day one we teach Marines to never leave another Marine behind, so to be part of the process of returning him to his family after all these years is a huge honor,” said Capt. Pierce Virag, Detachment One, Communication Company, Combat Logistics Regiment 45, 4th Marine Logistics Group inspector instructor. “We hope that this will help bring closure to his family.

In November 1943, Freet was assigned to Company F, 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines, 2nd Marine Division, Fleet Marine Force, which landed against stiff Japanese resistance on the small island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands, in an attempt to secure the island. Over several days of intense fighting, approximately 1,000 Sailors and Marines were killed and more than 2,000 were wounded, but the Japanese were virtually annihilated. Freet died on the first day of the battle, Nov. 20, 1943, during the first waves of the assault.

In the immediate aftermath of the fighting, U.S. service members who died in the battle were buried in a number of battlefield cemeteries on the island, but Freet’s remains were not identified.

In 2015, The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency received a unilateral turnover from History Flight, Inc., a nongovernmental organization, of remains recovered on Betio Island. To identify Freet’s remains, scientists from DPAA used dental, anthropological and chest radiograph comparison analysis, as well as circumstantial and material evidence.

Attending the dignified transfer were several relatives of Freet, who came to show their support to their long lost relative who gave the ultimate sacrifice for his country.

“Before today he was just a picture on a mantle to us,” said Bill Freet, a nephew who was born several years after his uncle joined the Marines. “This feels like a huge victory for our family because for so many years no one knew what happened to him.”

“The military and community has been extremely supportive throughout the process and we are grateful,” he said. 

 “Grissom is so proud to play a part in this hero’s return,” said Col. Larry Shaw, 434th Air Refueling Wing commander. “The culture of military heritage and the bond that we have for those that served before us was on full display with our Marines taking care of one of their own.”

Freet will be buried at the Marion National Cemetery in Marion Indiana on April 18, a resting place for over 8,000 veterans.

30,How a 76-year-old Vietnam Veteran was able to carry a fallen friend to the top of Hamburger Hill,"In 1968, Spc. James Baylor was one month away from his 26th birthday when he received his call to duty on his front doorstep. 
“I have this ability to go numb when things like that happen,” said Baylor about his draft notification from the U.S. Army.  “I’ll say to myself, ‘Ok, that’s what it is,’ and I’ll go numb.”
Baylor attended basic training and advanced individual training at Fort Ord, California. Upon course completion the senior drill sergeant called a formation for the trainees to notify them of their duty assignments. “Private Johnson, Hawaii!” the drill sergeant exclaimed. At that moment Baylor became excited about the possibilities that lie ahead until the drill sergeant opened his mouth again and said, “Everyone else, pack your bags, you’re going to the Republic of Vietnam.”  Yet again, Baylor went numb. 
A few weeks after he received his orders, Baylor was on a commercial flight to war. 
“One thing I remember about that experience is that when we started out, the flight attendants were young and attractive, and as we got closer and closer, they got older and older,” Baylor laughs as he recalls his deployment process. “I remember flying into country, and two jet fighters approached on either side of our plane. I had never seen a jet fighter up close, and I remember thinking then, that was it, and we were coming into something heavy.” 
As Baylor disembarked the aircraft, he passed veterans who were headed home. He distinctly remembers the battle hardened Soldiers looking at the inbound Soldiers and saying “There’s one, there’s one.” There’s one what? He thought. 
“These guys had obviously been through something; you could tell by their faces, they were hard,” Baylor recalls. 
Later, he found out they were pointing out the Soldiers they perceived would not make it home from Vietnam alive. 
When Baylor made it to in-processing to receive his assignment, he learned he was heading to the 101st Airborne Division. Baylor recalls his reaction thinking, “Hey, hey wait a minute, I’m not even Airborne.” 
The personnel officer quickly replied that he was ‘airborne now’ and to lace his boots tight. 
While in the rear echelon, Baylor met another Soldier who was headed to the 101st Airborne Division, Private Ralph Crutts, a 21-year-old college student who joined the military for college benefits to finish his degree. 
“I was 26 and Crutts was 21. I think he looked up to me because I was older and from Los Angeles. He thought I was rough and tough or something, that I was going to protect him,” said Baylor. 
Baylor and Crutts became extremely close during their time in Vietnam together as they were assigned to the same platoon in Charlie Company, 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment. Baylor describes Crutts as vigilant, always listening for enemy movement and ready to protect them. So vigilant that Baylor would often times read a book while their platoon was stationary because he knew he could count on his best friend to look out for them both. 
“He was very alert and always looking to see what was going on,” said Baylor. “I would relax a little bit, truly read a book in the boonies because I knew Crutts was always watching.”
As time passed, the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment was tasked with clearing the A Shau Valley, particularly hill 937, or Dong Ap Bia. On May 10, 1969, the battalion was dropped on the landing zone at the base of the hill. Each company moved out to their assigned axis of advance and Charlie Company moved further and further onto the base of the hill. 
While navigating the steep jungle terrain of the A Shau Valley and passing over the first moments of what would eventually culminate in a grueling 11 day battle, Baylor took guidance and direction from his platoon leader Lt. Joel Tautmann.
“We didn’t take any contact the first few days of the battle,” said Trautmann, the platoon leader for 1st Platoon, Charlie Company in an interview with the West Point Center for Oral History. “We could hear contact over the radio from the other companies, but the jungle was too thick to hear the fighting.” 
It wasn’t until the 14th of May that 1st Platoon was tasked with linking up with the company headquarters to reinforce 2nd and 3rd platoon, who were charging the hill. 
“When I reached Charlie Company’s position, 2nd and 3rd Platoons were both pinned down,” said Trautmann.  “I asked my commander for guidance, for a task and purpose, but he did not respond. He couldn’t even look me in the eye C mentally, he was gone.” 
Trautmann moved forward on the line to gain perspective on the situation. When he turned around, the commander was nowhere to be found. In the middle of a battle, the commander left the company for the night defensive position. 
“At that moment the weight of the world was on my shoulders,” Trautmann recalls. 
After taking heavy fire, Trautmann immediately organized all three platoons to lay down suppressive fire and retrieve their casualties. Baylor was tasked with recovering the wounded and killed in action. 
“I couldn’t recognize them,” said Baylor, “except for one man who wore a wrist watch on both arms. Their faces were completely gone. That memory would haunt me forever.” 
After being demoralized, Charlie Company reconsolidated and was tasked to secure the battalion command post for the next three days. On the 18th of May, the men of 1st Platoon would yet again face another test of courage. 
Delta Company was currently pinned down in active engagement. Trautmann was tasked to put together a squad-sized element to maneuver on the west flank to draw enemy fire and allow Delta Company to retrograde. When Trautmann told his men of the upcoming mission, they were apprehensive to say the least. 
“Hell no, we will not go. This mission is suicide,” said Trautmann, explaining his Soldiers’ emotional response. 
Knowing the state of morale of the platoon Trautmann knew of only one thing to do. 
“I didn’t know if they would follow me or not, but I grabbed my rifle and my pack and I walked right through my men and said ‘Follow me,’” Trautmann recalls. 
Eight men picked themselves up and followed the lieutenant, two of whom were Baylor and his best friend, Crutts. They approached the edge of the foliage that led to a vast opening of dirt without cover or concealment, and they charged. As they assaulted up the hill, they opened fire, and within moments one of the men yelled out, “Crutts is hit!” 
Baylor, with his eyes toward the enemy, then saw Trautmann take a bullet to the femur and drop. Concerned for his friend, Baylor turned around and grabbed Crutts and held him in his arms. 
“Are you ok? Crutts are you with me?” recalled Baylor. 
By then he was already gone, and while Baylor was holding Crutts, kneeling low, a round penetrated his side and Baylor went down. 
“If I wasn’t kneeling with Crutts, if I was standing, the round would have hit my spine. Crutts saved my life,” said Baylor. 
Baylor was evacuated off the hill without ever making it to the top.
These memories would stay buried deep in Baylor’s memory for the rest of his life, and as he grew older, his curiosity for the top of Hamburger Hill grew. 
“I’ve always envied those who have made it to the top,” he said.  “What was that like? When I heard members of the battalion were making a trip back to Vietnam with veterans, it was a no brainer for me.” 
Baylor summited Hamburger Hill at 76 years old. 

How vision became a reality for veteran Rakkasans 
This is just one of Baylor’s war stories, and many veteran’s stories would be lost or untold if it weren’t for guardians of history and heritage who facilitate opportunities for communion and reconciliation. That is exactly what Lt. Col. Martin Bowling facilitated during his command of the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment, Iron Rakkasans. 
“The Iron Rakkasans have a heritage, legacy, and reputation of being the most aggressive battalion, which always accomplishes the mission, and never backs down from a challenge,” said Bowling. “Those that have come before us earned that reputation in blood, sweat, and tears, and it is our duty to honor them for their sacrifices, and recognize them for their valor.”
During his two years in command, the month of May became a special month to reunite with the Rakkasans of Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, Afghanistan, and Iraq to pay tribute and honor them, especially the veterans of the famous, Battle of Hamburger Hill. Veterans across the country conduct reunions each year. The “Hamburger Hill Vets” reunite in the same location, Fort Campbell, Kentucky, home of the 101st Airborne Division. They do this to stay consistent in the hope that more veterans from the battle will hear of these reunions and stay connected to today’s generation of Rakkasan.
In May of 2019, current Rakkasan Soldiers honored the veterans of the Battle of Hamburger Hill, to include Spc. James Baylor, by returning to that hallowed battlefield in the A Shau Valley for on the battle’s 50th anniversary. 
It all started with a commander’s vision. Upon taking command in 2017, Bowling announced his first two priorities. The first, to build the most lethal platoons in the 101st Airborne Division who are ready to deploy, fight, and win in the most austere environments at any time. Second, to significantly enhance the relationships between currently serving and previous generations of Iron Rakkasans, Army veterans, and community leaders. 
It just turned out that his command window landed on the 49th and 50th anniversaries of the Battle of Hamburger Hill. However, the events that would occur in the next two years were much more deliberate than the timing of his career. 
From May 10 to May 20 1969, the men of the 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment would assault up a massive hill in the A Shau Valley of Vietnam known as Dong Ap Bia or “the Crouching Beast.” Then, Lt. Col. Weldon Honeycutt would command these brave Soldiers through the most trying times of their lives. The 11-day battle resulted in 70 percent of the formation wounded or killed in action while imparting 600 killed in action on the enemy. 
In a war that some would rather forget, and memories that are most times too hard to face, how do we honor such men who were called to make the ultimate sacrifice? Bowling’s answer was simple. 
“We will bring them in, execute a physical challenge that represents the sacrifices they made, wrap our arms around them, and welcome them home,” said Bowling. “Oh yeah, and we’re going to take them back to Vietnam.” 
On the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of Hamburger Hill, hundreds of Screaming Eagle Soldiers and local citizens welcomed home 87 Hamburger Hill veterans for the first time at Fort Campbell. The next day, nine veterans and 11 Soldiers boarded an aircraft and flew to Da Nang Airport, for a five-day journey recounting the steps they took exactly 50 years earlier. 
“I’m proud of myself for being able to hike up that mountain at 76,” said Baylor. “And while I was hiking, I said a little prayer. I told Crutts I was going to make it to the top of the hill for both of us, that I was determined! Even if I had to crawl, I was going to get to the top. And we did, we made it to the top of the hill together.”",2020/7/17,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/374108/76-year-old-vietnam-veteran-able-carry-fallen-friend-top-hamburger-hill,"TN, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国田纳西州,一位76岁的越战老兵是如何将一位倒下的朋友抬到汉堡包山的山顶的,1968年，Spc.詹姆斯・贝勒在离他26岁生日还有一个月的时候接到了在前门台阶上值勤的电话。贝勒在谈到美国陆军的征兵通知时说：“当这种情况发生时，我有能力变得麻木。”。“我会对自己说，‘好吧，就是这样，’然后我会变得麻木。”贝勒在加利福尼亚州的福特参加了基础训练和高级个人训练。课程结束后，高级军士长召集学员列队通知他们的任务。“二等兵约翰逊，夏威夷！”教官惊叫道。就在那一刻，贝勒对未来的可能性感到兴奋，直到训练中士再次张开嘴说：“其他人，收拾好行李，你要去越南共和国。”贝勒再次变得麻木。贝勒接到命令几周后，他乘坐商业航班前往战场。贝勒回忆起自己的部署过程时笑着说：“我记得那次经历的一件事是，我们刚开始时，空乘人员年轻而有魅力，随着我们越来越近，他们也越来越老了。”。“我记得我飞到这个国家，两架喷气式战斗机从我们飞机的两侧飞过来。我从来没有近距离看到过喷气式战斗机，我记得当时在想，就是这样，我们遇到了一件很重的事情。”贝勒下飞机时，经过了正在回家的退伍军人。他清楚地记得那些身经百战的士兵看着入境的士兵说：“有一个，有一个。”有一个什么？他想。贝勒回忆道：“这些人显然经历了一些事情；从他们的脸上可以看出，他们很坚强。”。后来，他发现他们指出，他们所看到的士兵不会活着从越南回来。当贝勒到达处理中心接受任务时，他得知自己正前往101空降师。贝勒回忆起当时的反应：“嘿，嘿，等一下，我甚至还没有空降。”人事官员很快回答说他“现在空降了”，并系紧了靴子。在后方梯队时，贝勒遇到了另一名前往101空降师的士兵，二等兵拉尔夫・克鲁茨（Ralph Crutts），他是一名21岁的大学生，为了大学福利参军完成学业。贝勒说：“我当时26岁，克鲁茨21岁。我想他之所以尊敬我，是因为我年纪大了，而且来自洛杉矶。他认为我粗鲁、强硬，或者其他什么，我会保护他。”。贝勒和克鲁茨在越战期间非常亲密，因为他们被分配到第187步兵团第3营查理连的同一排。贝勒形容克鲁特机警，总是倾听敌人的动向，随时准备保护他们。贝勒非常警觉，经常在他们的排停着的时候读一本书，因为他知道他可以依靠他最好的朋友来照顾他们。贝勒说：“他非常警觉，总是想看看发生了什么。”。“我会放松一点，在乡下读一本书，因为我知道克鲁茨一直在看。”随着时间的推移，第187步兵团第3营的任务是清理阿绍山谷，特别是937山，或称东阿比亚。1969年5月10日，该营降落在山脚的登陆区。每个连队都向指定的前进轴移动，查理连队向山脚移动得越来越远。当贝勒在阿绍山谷陡峭的丛林地带航行，经过最终将在一场艰苦的11天战斗中达到高潮的最初时刻时，他接受了排长乔尔・陶特曼中尉的指导和指示。“我们在战斗的最初几天并没有取得任何联系，”特劳特曼说，查理连第一排的排长在接受西点军校口述历史中心采访时说。“我们可以通过无线电听到其他连队的联系，但丛林太厚，听不到战斗声。”直到5月14日，第一排才接到与连队总部联系的任务，以增援正在冲锋的第二排和第三排。“当我到达查理连的位置时，第二排和第三排都被牵制住了，”特罗特曼说。“为了一项任务和目的，我向我的指挥官寻求指导，但他没有回应。他甚至不能直视我的眼睛――精神上，他已经走了。”特劳特曼继续前行，以了解形势。当他转过身来时，指挥官已无处可寻。在战斗中，指挥官离开了公司进行夜间防御工作。“当时，世界的重担压在我的肩上，”特劳特曼回忆道。在遭受猛烈炮击后，特劳特曼立即组织所有三个排放下压制火力，取回伤亡人员。贝勒的任务是抢救行动中受伤和死亡的人。“我认不出他们，”贝勒说，“除了一个两臂都戴着手表的人。他们的脸完全消失了。那种记忆将永远萦绕在我的心头。”在士气低落后，查理连重新团结起来，并被派去在接下来的三天里保卫营指挥所。5月18日，第一排的士兵将再次面临勇气的考验。德尔塔公司目前正在积极参与。特劳特曼的任务是组建一个小队大小的分队，在西侧机动，吸引敌人火力，并允许三角洲连逆行。当特罗特曼告诉他的部下即将进行的任务时，他们至少有点担心。“不，我们不会去。这次任务是自杀，”特劳特曼解释士兵们的情绪反应说。了解排的士气状况，特劳特曼只知道一件事要做。“我不知道他们是否会跟着我，但我抓起我的步枪和背包，径直穿过我的士兵说‘跟着我’，”特劳特曼回忆道。八个人站起来，跟着中尉，其中两人是贝勒和他最好的朋友克鲁茨。他们走近树叶的边缘，这导致了一个巨大的没有遮盖或隐藏的泥土开口，他们冲锋。当他们向山上发起进攻时，他们开火了，不一会儿，其中一名男子大声喊道：“克鲁兹中弹了！”贝勒眼睛盯着敌人，然后看到特劳特曼的股骨中了一颗子弹，然后倒下了。出于对朋友的关心，贝勒转过身，抓住克鲁特，将他搂在怀里。“你还好吗？克鲁特，你和我在一起吗？”贝勒回忆道。这时他已经走了，贝勒正抱着拐杖跪着，一颗子弹穿透了他的身体，贝勒倒了下去。贝勒说：“如果我不是用拐杖跪着，如果我站着，子弹就会击中我的脊柱。拐杖救了我的命。”。贝勒没有登上山顶就被疏散了。这些记忆将在贝勒的余生中深深地埋藏在他的记忆中，随着年龄的增长，他对汉堡包山顶的好奇心也在增长。“我一直羡慕那些登上顶峰的人，”他说。“那是什么样子的？当我听说营里的人正和老兵们一起回越南旅行时，这对我来说是一件轻而易举的事。”贝勒在76岁的时候对汉堡包山说。这只是贝勒战争故事中的一个，如果没有历史和遗产的守护者为交流与和解提供机会，许多退伍军人的故事将会丢失或不为人知。这正是马丁・鲍林中校在指挥第187步兵团第3营铁拉卡桑时所促成的。保林说：“铁拉卡桑人有着作为最具侵略性的营的传统、遗产和声誉，他们总是完成任务，从不放弃挑战。”。“那些在我们面前的人以鲜血、汗水和眼泪赢得了这一声誉，我们有责任对他们的牺牲表示敬意，并表彰他们的英勇。”在他执政的两年中，5月成为一个特殊的月份，与朝鲜、越南、沙漠风暴、阿富汗的Rakkasans人团聚，伊拉克向他们致敬，特别是著名的汉堡山战役的老兵。全国各地的退伍军人每年都会举行团聚。“汉堡包山兽医”在肯塔基州坎贝尔堡的同一地点团聚，这里是101空降师的所在地。他们这样做是为了保持一致，希望更多的退伍军人能够听到这些团聚，并与今天的拉卡山一代保持联系。2019年5月，现任拉卡山士兵向汉堡山战役的退伍军人致敬，其中包括Spc.詹姆斯・贝勒，在战争50周年之际，回到阿绍山谷的神圣战场。这一切都是从指挥官的远见开始的。2017年担任指挥职务后，保龄球宣布了他的前两个优先事项。第一，在101空降师建立最具杀伤力的排，他们随时准备在最严峻的环境中部署、作战并获胜。第二，显著加强现役和前几代铁人、退伍军人和社区领袖之间的关系。事实证明，他的指挥窗口是在汉堡包山战役49和50周年纪念日登陆的。然而，未来两年发生的事件比他职业生涯的时间安排要深思熟虑得多。1969年5月10日至5月20日，第187步兵团第3营的士兵将向越南阿绍河谷的一座巨大山丘发起进攻，这座山丘被称为“东阿彼亚”或“蹲着的野兽”。随后，韦尔登・霍尼卡特中校将指挥这些勇敢的士兵度过他们一生中最艰难的时期。在11天的战斗中，70%的编队在战斗中受伤或死亡，600人在战斗中阵亡。在战争中
31,"Coast Guard Cutter Sherman returns home from Bering Sea, final deployment","HONOLULU ― The crew of Coast Guard Cutter Sherman (WHEC 720) returned home Tuesday after a 76-day patrol in the Bering Sea.

This homecoming was the last time Sherman will return from deployment as the crew prepares to decommission the ship in March, after nearly 50 years of meritorious service.

During the three-month patrol, the crew supported the safe transit of a disabled vessel over 800 miles to Dutch Harbor, enforced fisheries regulations in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. They also provided a command and control platform capable of embarking a helicopter, thus providing search and rescue coverage to those operating in the Bering Sea.

Sherman has a storied history including being the last active remaining U.S. warship in the Coast Guard or Navy to have sunk an enemy vessel. It is also one of only two cutters to hold the Vietnam Service Award and the only cutter to hold the Combat Action Ribbon for action in the Vietnam War.

In 2001, it became one of the few cutters to circumnavigate the world, after conducting U.N. sanctions enforcement duty in the Persian Gulf and goodwill projects in Madagascar, South Africa and Cape Verde.

Adding to Sherman’s history, in March of 2007, a boarding team dispatched from the cutter discovered 17 metric tons of cocaine on the Panamanian-flagged freighter, Gatun. This seizure remains the largest drug bust in U.S. history with an estimated street value of $600 million. As the record holder, Sherman proudly wears the Golden Snowflake.

The crew rounded out the cutter’s storied career in the Bering Sea; conducting 16 fisheries boardings, issuing four fisheries violations and one safety violation, ensuring the integrity of the $6 billion fishing industry. As the primary search and rescue asset in the region at the time, Sherman also ensured the safe transit of the crew of the Resolve Pioneer, a Dutch Harbor-based ocean-going tug, following a severe casualty at the far end of the Aleutian chain, restricting their speed and maneuverability.

“As Sherman and her crew return home from this final patrol, it is humbling to look back on the history and the accomplishments of this crew and the previous,” said Capt. Steve Wittrock, commanding officer of Sherman. “This final patrol has been significant in that the Bering Sea mission is one of the most demanding and historically important in the Coast Guard and I am very proud of the way that the crew has performed throughout the last two challenging months.”

Sherman is one of the Coast Guard’s four remaining 378-foot high endurance cutters still in operation. The 1960s era fleet of cutters is presently being replaced by the national security cutters, which will soon serve as the Coast Guard's primary, long-range asset. Honolulu will serve as a homeport to two of the national security cutters, replacing Sherman and the already decommissioned Morgenthau.",2018/1/23,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/263033/coast-guard-cutter-sherman-returns-home-bering-sea-final-deployment,"HONOLULU, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],檀香山，你好，美国,海岸警卫队切割机谢尔曼从白令海返回家园，最终部署,檀香山-海岸警卫队“谢尔曼”号航母（WHEC 720）的船员周二在白令海进行了76天的巡逻后返回家园。这次返乡是谢尔曼号航母在服役近50年后准备于3月份退役时最后一次返回家园。在为期三个月的巡逻中，船员们支持一艘残疾船只在800英里外安全通过荷兰港口，在白令海和阿拉斯加湾执行渔业条例。他们还提供了一个能够登上直升机的指挥和控制平台，从而为在白令海作业的人员提供搜索和救援。谢尔曼有着悠久的历史，包括作为海岸警卫队或海军中最后一艘击沉敌舰的现役美国军舰。它也是唯一两个获得越战服务奖的切割机之一，也是唯一一个在越战中获得战斗行动丝带的切割机。2001年，它在波斯湾执行联合国制裁执行任务和在马达加斯加执行友好项目后，成为为数不多的环球航行切割机之一，除了谢尔曼的历史，2007年3月，卡特号派出的一个登机队在悬挂巴拿马国旗的货轮“加顿”上发现了17公吨可卡因。这次缉获的毒品仍然是美国历史上最大的一次缉毒行动，估计街头价值6亿美元。作为纪录保持者，谢尔曼自豪地佩戴着金色雪花。船员们在白令海圆满结束了这位切割者传奇般的职业生涯；进行了16次渔业登船，发布了4次渔业违规和1次安全违规，确保了60亿美元渔业的完整性。作为当时该地区的主要搜救资产，谢尔曼还确保了位于荷兰港口的远洋拖船“Resolve Pioneer”的船员安全通过，因为阿留申链远端发生了严重伤亡，限制了他们的速度和机动性。谢尔曼的指挥官史蒂夫・威特罗克上尉说：“当谢尔曼和她的船员们结束最后一次巡逻回家时，回顾他们的历史和成就是一件令人谦卑的事。”。“这次最后的巡逻意义重大，因为白令海任务是海岸警卫队中要求最高、历史上最重要的任务之一，我对船员在过去两个充满挑战的月中的表现感到非常自豪。”谢尔曼是海岸警卫队剩余的四艘仍在使用的378英尺高耐久性切割机之一。1960年代的切割机舰队目前正被国家安全切割机所取代，这将很快成为海岸警卫队的主要远程资产。火奴鲁鲁将作为两艘国家安全切割机（replac）的母港ing谢尔曼和已经退役的摩根索。
32,"Reflections, Respect on Clinic Namesake","Navy Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class David R. Ray would have been 76 years old this year.  

The Congressional Medal of Honor recipient (posthumously) and namesake of Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Unit (NMRTU) Everett was killed in action - a lifetime ago - for his actions at Phu Loc 6 near An Hoa in Quang Nam Province, Republic of Vietnam, on March 19, 1969. 

Gone but never forgotten. 

From that fateful day 52 years ago, the legacy of the man is embodied by staff at NMRTU Everett, located within the David R. Ray Branch Medical Clinic, caring for eligible beneficiaries in the greater Naval Station Everett area.

For hospital corpsman stationed at the clinic, there is symbolic significance following in such hallowed footsteps.

“I find it very significant to work anywhere named after someone who came before. There is a lot of pride knowing you represent someone who made the highest sacrifice for our country, and seeing their picture and citation every day as you walk in,” said Hospital Corpsman 2nd Class Emilio Alejandro Lugo, a Poulsbo, Washington native who has been assigned to the clinic for two of his eight years in the Navy. 

 “It is very significant to work within a facility named after a hospital corpsman who’s a Medal of Honor recipient, as it sets the highest standard while wearing the cloth of our nation and assisting those in need of healthcare,” added Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Crystal Jeanette Zamora, from Douglas, Arizona, who has been stationed at the clinic for three of her four years in the Navy.

The high regard that the clinic Sailors have for Ray has even become a mobile form of respect, venturing far beyond the clinic. The command’s guidon has become an emblematic source of pride and esprit de corps for staff members, especially during the ongoing pandemic and helping to stop the spread of COVID-19. Through rain and snow, in urban and rural backdrops, at work and off duty, clinic corpsmen have carried and displayed the guidon.

“The outings with the guidon enable us to show these incredible characteristics off with great pride, honor, and commitment that will encourage us to carry on such a legacy,” exclaimed Zamora. “This sentiment is significant and noteworthy in a way that demonstrates the bravery, selflessness, and act of heroism shown by HM2 David R. Ray.”

Chief Hospital Corpsman Sam Hutcheson affirms that NMRTU Everett Sailors taking the David R. Ray guidon on various outings is a notable way to show HM2 Ray’s memory is still alive. 

“I am really blessed to be surrounded by so many talented and motivated Sailors. The level of creativity that went into the preparation and execution of demonstrating the pride and admiration that we have for David R. Ray was next level. To be able to get out into our surrounding areas, through various weather conditions and take a moment to reflect on his sacrifices, is the very least we could do for a hero who gave the ultimate sacrifice for his country and his comrades in arms. His legacy lives on through these sailors. They take tremendous pride in knowing that,” stressed Hutcheson, from Gainesville, Florida, who has been at the clinic for three of his 23 active duty years.

“It shows the value in honoring the legacies of those who have gone before. Going out with the guidon is significantly better than just a cake or something because we aren’t just getting something out of it. We’re going out in what many people consider less than ideal weather while upholding Navy core values to show a commitment to honor,” Lugo said, readily acknowledging that the Navy Hospital Corps rate is known for putting service before self, and that very notion C exemplified by David R Ray C is inspirational.

“I chose this rate because of that legacy,” continued Lugo. “When people ask what it is I do in the Navy, I love being able to say I’m a corpsman. Every veteran knows what a corpsman is, what we do, and the legacies that we are willing to live up to. That legacy is also a great motivational tool that require us to put in a bit more work. We’re the most decorated rate in the Navy for a reason.” 

Zamora attests the legacy of service before self inspires her. 

“It motivates me to do everything in my power to assist those in need and assist my fellow Sailors around me. I’m inspired to be selfless and always caring as HM2 David R. Ray was. I hope these characteristics are passed on, and have such an effect and purpose on future hospital corpsmen,” said Zamora. 

As a senior enlisted leader, Hutcheson candidly states that putting service before self has been the standard since the inception of the Navy Hospital Corps, with Ray the epitome of that trait.

“Read his citation of action and try not getting motivated, I dare you. Everything is about perspective. When you think you’re having a rough day, just thinking about being under enemy fire and still going from parapet to parapet tending to wounded Marines while being injured, helps bring everything into focus,” explained Hutcheson. 

When asked how would you respond to someone with no real knowledge about the Navy who is curious enough to ask, ‘who was HM2 David R. Ray,’ Lugo replied,  “Beyond a Medal of Honor recipient, he was a kid from Tennessee who died putting the welfare of the Marines under his charge ahead of his own. Because of him, someone else’s son was able to come home from the jungles of Vietnam during a time when military service wasn’t voluntary. Neither of them may have wanted to be there, and both of them could have potentially died out there, but because of HM2 Ray’s sacrifice, at least one of them came back. Now, he inspires future generations of hospital corpsmen to uphold that same level of fidelity during the most difficult of times.”

Asked the same question, Zamora answered, “the hospital corpsman rate is one of the most honorable and decorated rates in the United States Navy. David R. Ray resembles the exact reason for this, as he risked his life beyond the call of duty, rendering aid to his Marines and portraying acts of heroism by sacrificing his own life for a patient, all while being wounded himself. It is this legacy and inspiration that make being a hospital corpsman so honorable, rewarding, and selfless.” 

“For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving as a HM2 with Battery D, 2d Battalion, at Phu Loc 6, near An Hoa. During the early morning hours, an estimated battalion-sized enemy force launched a determined assault against the battery's position, and succeeded in effecting a penetration of the barbed-wire perimeter. The initial burst of enemy fire caused numerous casualties among the marines who had immediately manned their howitzers during the rocket and mortar attack. Undaunted by the intense hostile fire, HM2 Ray moved from parapet to parapet, rendering emergency medical treatment to the wounded. Although seriously wounded himself while administering first aid to a marine casualty, he refused medical aid and continued his lifesaving efforts. While he was bandaging and attempting to comfort another wounded marine, HM2 Ray was forced to battle two enemy soldiers who attacked his position, personally killing one and wounding the other. Rapidly losing his strength as a result of his severe wounds, he nonetheless managed to move through the hail of enemy fire to other casualties. Once again, he was faced with the intense fire of oncoming enemy troops and, despite the grave personal danger and insurmountable odds, succeeded in treating the wounded and holding off the enemy until he ran out of ammunition, at which time he sustained fatal wounds. HM2 Ray's final act of heroism was to protect the patient he was treating. He threw himself upon the wounded marine, thus saving the man's life when an enemy grenade exploded nearby. By his determined and persevering actions, courageous spirit, and selfless devotion to the welfare of his marine comrades, HM2 Ray served to inspire the men of Battery D to heroic efforts in defeating the enemy. His conduct throughout was in keeping with the finest traditions of the U.S. Naval Service.”

To be able to work in a facility named after one of the 23 hospital corpsman Medal of Honor recipients is a real honor and also very humbling,” stated Hutcheson.",2021/3/15,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/391417/reflections-respect-clinic-namesake,"EVERETT, WA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国华盛顿州埃弗雷特,对同名诊所的反思与尊重,海军医院二等兵大卫・R・雷今年已经76岁了。1969年3月19日，国会荣誉勋章获得者（死后）和海军医疗准备和训练部队（NMRTU）的同名人员埃弗雷特因其在越南共和国广南省安和附近的福禄6号战地中的行为而在战斗中被杀。过去了，但从未忘记。从52年前的那一天起，这位老人的遗产就体现在位于大卫・R・雷分支医疗诊所内的NMRTU埃弗雷特的工作人员身上，他们照顾着大海军基地埃弗雷特地区的合格受益人。对于驻扎在该诊所的医院医务人员来说，追随这样神圣的脚步具有象征意义。“我觉得在任何以某位前辈名字命名的地方工作都很有意义。知道你代表了一位为我们国家做出最大牺牲的人，每天走进来都能看到他们的照片和引文，我感到非常自豪。”医院二等兵埃米利奥・亚历杭德罗・卢戈（Emilio Alejandro Lugo）说，他是华盛顿土生土长的波尔斯波人，在海军服役的八年中，有两年被分配到该诊所。“在以荣誉勋章获得者医院医务人员的名字命名的设施内工作是非常重要的，因为它在穿着我们国家的衣服和帮助需要医疗保健的人时设定了最高标准。”来自亚利桑那州道格拉斯的医院三等兵克里斯托・珍妮特・萨莫拉（Crystal Jeanette Zamora）补充道，她在海军的四年中有三年一直驻扎在该诊所。诊所水手对雷的高度尊重甚至已经成为一种流动的尊重形式，远远超越了诊所。司令部的吉东已经成为pri的象征性来源特别是在目前的流感大流行期间，帮助阻止新冠病毒的传播。在雨雪中，在城市和农村背景下，在工作和下班时，诊所的医务人员携带并展示了guidon。萨莫拉感叹道：“与圭登号一起出游使我们能够以极大的自豪、荣誉和承诺来展示这些令人难以置信的特征，这将鼓励我们继承这一遗产。这种情感意义重大，值得注意，它展示了HM2大卫・R・雷号所表现出的勇敢、无私和英雄主义行为。”首席医院护卫员山姆・哈奇森（Sam Hutcheson）证实，NMRTU埃弗雷特水兵乘坐大卫・R・雷・吉登（David R.Ray guidon）进行各种远足是一种值得注意的方式，以显示HM2雷的记忆仍然健在。“我真的很幸运能被这么多才华横溢、积极进取的水手所包围。在准备和执行大卫・R・雷的自豪感和仰慕之情的过程中，我们的创造力达到了一个新的水平。能够在各种天气条件下进入我们周围的地区，并花一点时间来参考哈奇森来自佛罗里达州盖恩斯维尔，他在诊所工作了23年。他强调说：“选择他的牺牲，是我们能为一位英雄做的最起码的事情，这位英雄为他的国家和战友做出了最大的牺牲。他的遗产通过这些水手得以延续。他们为此感到无比自豪。”。“它显示了尊重那些曾经去过的人的遗产的价值。与GuoDon一起出去，比仅仅是蛋糕或其他东西要好得多，因为我们不仅仅是从中得到一些东西。我们走出去，在许多人认为不那么理想的天气的同时，坚持海军核心价值观来表现出对荣誉的承诺。”卢戈说，他欣然承认海军医疗队的收费标准以服务高于自我而闻名，而这一理念――以大卫・R・雷（David R Ray）为例――是鼓舞人心的。“我选择这一收费标准是因为这一传统，”卢戈继续说。“当人们问我在海军做什么时，我喜欢说我是一名护卫兵。每个退伍军人都知道护卫兵是什么，我们做什么，以及我们愿意履行的遗产。这一遗产也是一个伟大的激励工具，需要我们投入更多的工作。我们是海军中装饰率最高的，这是有原因的。”萨莫拉在自我激励之前证明了服务的传统。“这激励着我尽我所能去帮助那些需要帮助的人，帮助我身边的水手们。我被激励着像HM2 David R.Ray那样无私和始终关心他人。我希望这些特征能够传承下去，并对未来的医院医务人员产生这样的影响和作用。”作为一名高级应征领导人，哈奇森坦率地表示，自海军医院军成立以来，将服务置于自我之前一直是标准，雷就是这种特质的缩影。“我敢说，请阅读他的行动引文，尽量不要被激励。一切都是关于视角的。当你觉得今天很艰难的时候，只要想想在敌人的炮火下，在受伤时仍然从一个护墙到另一个护墙照顾受伤的海军陆战队，就有助于集中注意力。”哈奇森解释道，当被问到你会如何回应一个对海军一无所知的人，他好奇地问，“谁是HM2大卫・R・雷，”卢戈回答说，“除了荣誉勋章获得者，他还是一个来自田纳西州的孩子，他死的时候把海军陆战队的福利放在他自己的责任之前。因为他，其他人的儿子能够从越南的丛林中回家，当时服兵役不是自愿的。他们两人可能都不想去那里，而且两人都不想去可能已经死在那里了，但由于HM2 Ray的牺牲，他们中至少有一人回来了。现在，他激励未来几代医院的医务人员在最困难的时候保持同样的忠诚。”萨莫拉回答了同样的问题，“医院的医务人员费用是美国海军中最光荣、最有荣誉感的费用之一。大卫・R・雷（David R.Ray）的确切原因与此相似，因为他冒着生命危险超越职责范围，为海军陆战队提供援助，并在受伤的同时为一名患者牺牲自己的生命，表现出英雄行为。就是这样遗产和灵感，使成为一名医院医务人员变得如此光荣、有回报和无私。”“在安和附近的Phu Loc 6，第二营D连担任HM2时，表现出明显的英勇无畏，冒着生命危险，超出职责范围。清晨时分，估计有一个营大小的敌军对D连阵地发起了坚决的攻击，并成功地实施了pe铁丝网周围的网络。最初的敌人炮火爆发造成了海军陆战队的大量伤亡，他们在火箭和迫击炮攻击中立即使用榴弹炮。HM2射线在激烈的敌对火力下毫不气馁，从一个护墙移动到另一个护墙，为伤员提供了紧急医疗。尽管伤势严重在对一名海军陆战队伤员进行急救时受伤，他拒绝医疗救助，继续救生。当他包扎并试图安慰另一名受伤的海军陆战队士兵时，HM2 Ray被迫与两名攻击他的阵地的敌军士兵作战，一人死亡，一人受伤。他迅速失去了体力h由于伤势严重，他仍然设法在敌人炮火的冰雹中转移到其他伤亡者身上。他再次面临迎面而来的敌军的猛烈炮火，尽管存在严重的人身危险和不可逾越的困难，他还是成功地治疗了伤者并挡住了敌人，直到弹药耗尽这一次他受了致命伤。HM2 Ray最后的英勇行为是保护他正在治疗的病人。他将自己投靠在受伤的海军陆战队员身上，从而在附近一枚敌方手榴弹爆炸时救了这名男子的命。凭借他坚定和坚持不懈的行动、勇敢的精神以及对海军战友福利的无私奉献，HM2雷激励了D连的士兵们英勇地战胜敌人。他的行为始终符合美国海军服役的最优良传统。”哈奇森说：“作为一名医院护卫员，你总是非常清楚在你的时代之前已经铺好的遗产。能够在以23名医院护卫员荣誉勋章获得者之一命名的设施中工作是一种真正的荣誉，也是一种非常谦卑的荣誉。”。
33,Coming Full Circle,"RICHMOND, Va. - Born and raised in Burlington, New Jersey, a suburb of Philadelphia, Aviation Boatswain’s Mate Nevin Stevens grew up playing hockey and rooting for the Philadelphia Flyers, Phillies and 76’ers.

Upon graduation from high school, Stevens did not know what he wanted to do in life. What he did know however, was that college was not it. 

One day, and with no intention of joining the military, he drove a friend to a Navy recruiting station. As the saying goes, “The rest is history.”  

Stevens has been in the Navy for seven years. His first assignment had him operating, maintaining and performing maintenance on steam catapults, barricades and arresting gear aboard the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75). 

His most recent two years have been spent as a recruiter at NRS Virginia Beach, part of Navy Talent Acquisition Group Richmond.

After buying a house in Virginia Beach, working for recruiting just made sense.

“I came from a divorced family and moved around a lot up until the age of 8 when I moved in with my father,” said Stevens. “I wanted to have a way to where my 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son could have a home to grow up in.” 

Making the decision to join the Navy at 18 was the best thing he could have done, said Stevens. He said without the Navy he would not have started a family nor would he have been able to provide for them the way he does. 

“My family is the reason why I have stayed in the Navy, for the simple fact of I love what I do and it’s a sense of security to be able to support them.”

There was a learning curve for Stevens on his transition to recruiting. Getting familiar with the different forms an applicant needs to join the Navy and the process of making initial contact with potential applicants were some of his challenges. 

He said he wasn’t the type of person to just approach people and strike up conversations.

“I usually go out prospecting with another recruiter so they can start the conversation, then I join in,” he said. “Or I find something I might have in common with the individual and talk about that. That puts us both more at ease.”

Despite the initial adjustments, Stevens has settled into recruiting just fine. In October 2020, for his outstanding efforts and accomplishments in recruiting, he was meritoriously promoted to the rank of first class petty officer, pay effective immediately.

Though the personal accolades are flattering, Stevens said being able to help people better their lives by joining the Navy is what really matters to him. When he gets calls from Sailors who have graduated boot camp, thanking him for mentoring them, that’s what makes it all worth it, said Stevens.  

“It doesn’t get any better than that,” Stevens said with a smile. “That, and giving people a chance to be a part of something bigger than themselves.”

Being able to spread Navy awareness to people who may not think the Navy is for them is a feeling that comes full circle for Stevens.  

From an 18-year-old kid offering a ride to a friend, to a Petty Officer 1st Class who now offers careers, what a difference seven years makes.

At the end of this year, Navy Recruiting Command will consist of a command headquarters, three Navy Recruiting Regions, 26 NTAGs and 64 Talent Acquisition Onboarding Centers (TAOCs) that will serve more than 1,000 recruiting stations around the world. Their mission is to attract the highest quality candidates to assure the ongoing success of America’s Navy.

34,World War II Veteran Renews Bond with 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne) During 60th Anniversary Celebration,"“I exercised this morning just like I have every day since I retired,” he told members of 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne) assembled to celebrate the unit’s 60th Anniversary. “I am humbled to meet such a great group of men. I feel like my experience in World War II inspired a lot of the development of how Special Forces now operates.”

Gutierrez served with the First Special Service Force (FSSF) during World War II, storming the beaches in Anzio, Italy, liberating southern France, and re-claiming Rome from the Nazis. He visited here to celebrate the 1st SFG (A)’s 60th Anniversary on June 24, 2017.

When 1st SFG (A) stood up in 1957, it drew its lineage from the First Special Service Force.

The FSSF was made up of 900 American and 900 Canadian volunteers who assembled in Helena, Mont., to answer the call for men of the highest physical prowess to fight in an unknown unit at an unknown location for an unknown operation. The men were trained in commando tactics that included mountain climbing, skiing, demolition, amphibious training, and hand-to-hand combat, using the historic V42 knife for close-quarters fighting. Nicknamed the “Devil’s Brigade” by German Soldiers for their fierce tactics and practice of wearing black boot polish on their faces, the unit excelled during nighttime raids.

By the time the war ended, the brigade had captured more than 30,000 prisoners, won five U.S. campaign stars and eight Canadian battle honors.

To celebrate and honor the influence of Gutierrez and his ilk, 1st SFG (A) chose to do something a little different than conducting an airborne operation or having a formal Dining Out. In the spirit of the men who came before them, the anniversary was celebrated with a strenuous round-robin training event featuring six stations. Each station featured a 1st SFG (A) veteran who quizzed current unit members about their lineage and history.

“We can benefit from the living history in our ranks,” said Col. Guillaume Beaurpere, the 1st SFG (A) commander. “Heroes like Eugene can teach us a lot about commitment and sacrifice.”

Gutierrez joined the Army in 1941 after his family was devastated during the Great Depression. “I had seven siblings and my dad lost his grocery business,” Gutierrez said. “My family needed me to help financially and the Army paid $40 a month.”

After graduating high school, Gutierrez enlisted in the Army, sending money back to his family and saving some for college. He figured that three years of service would pay for two years of college. Little did he know, he would find himself on multiple front lines during four years of service.

“When I went to enlist, I weighed two pounds under the minimum weight allowance,” Gutierrez explained. “At 118 pounds, the recruiter told me to go home and eat nothing but bananas and return the next day. He told me when I was full to eat even more bananas.”

Initially Gutierrez joined the Army Air Corps specializing in parachute rigging, and that road led him to the First Special Service Force.

In total, Gutierrez saw 240 days of combat from December 1943 to December 1944. On December 4, 1944, the First Special Service Force was terminated because there was trouble finding replacements for such an elite unit, and larger, division-size elements were needed to fight.

After the war, Gutierrez returned to Texas, marrying his wife Penny in 1951; the two are still married after 66 years. Gutierrez went into teaching, and retired as a school principal in 1990.

“You all are defending my freedom,” Gutierrez told the 1st SFG (A) Soldiers, “I wish you the best in the world.”",2017/6/23,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/239418/world-war-ii-veteran-renews-bond-with-1st-special-forces-group-airborne-during-60th-anniversary-celebration,"JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, WA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国华盛顿州刘易斯-麦考德联合基地,二战退伍军人在60周年庆典期间与第一特种部队集团（空降）续约,他告诉聚集在一起庆祝部队成立60周年的第一特种部队（空降部队）的成员说：“我今天早上锻炼身体，就像我退休后每天一样。”。“我很荣幸能见到这么多人。我觉得我在第二次世界大战中的经历在很大程度上启发了特种部队目前运作方式的发展。”古铁雷斯在第二次世界大战期间与第一支特种部队（FSSF）一起服役，冲进意大利安齐奥的海滩，解放了法国南部，从纳粹手中夺回罗马。2017年6月24日，他来到这里庆祝第一届SFG（A）成立60周年。当第一届SFG（A）于1957年成立时，它从第一支特种部队中继承下来。FSSF由900名美国和900名加拿大志愿者组成，他们聚集在蒙大拿州的赫勒拿。，响应号召，让最有体力的人在未知的地点，在未知的单位里为未知的行动而战。这些人接受突击队战术训练，包括爬山、滑雪、爆破、两栖训练和肉搏战，使用历史悠久的V42刀进行近距离战斗。德军士兵以其凶猛的战术和在脸上涂黑鞋油的做法，给该部队起了“魔鬼旅”的绰号。该部队在夜间突袭中表现出色。战争结束时，该旅已俘获3万多名囚犯，赢得了五个美国战役明星和八个加拿大战役荣誉。为了庆祝和表彰古铁雷斯及其同僚的影响，第一SFG（A）选择了做一些与执行空降行动或正式外出就餐略有不同的事情。本着先驱者的精神，纪念活动以六个电台为特色，进行了艰苦的循环训练。每个车站都有一名第一SFG（a）老兵，他询问了当前部队成员的血统和历史。第一SFG（a）指挥官纪尧姆・博佩尔上校说：“我们可以从我们队伍中活生生的历史中获益。”。“像尤金这样的英雄可以教会我们很多关于承诺和牺牲的东西。”古铁雷斯在1941年加入军队，当时他的家庭在大萧条期间遭到毁灭。古铁雷斯说：“我有七个兄弟姐妹，我爸爸失去了他的杂货生意。”。“我的家人需要我提供经济帮助，军队每月支付40美元。”高中毕业后，古铁雷斯应征入伍，将钱寄回家人，并为上大学存了一些钱。他估计三年的服务费可以支付两年的大学学费。古铁雷斯解释说：“当我入伍时，我的体重低于最低限额两磅。”。“体重118磅的征兵员让我回家，只吃香蕉，第二天再回来。他告诉我，当我吃饱的时候，他可以吃更多的香蕉。”最初，古铁雷斯加入了陆军航空队，专攻降落伞装配，这条路把他带到了第一支特种部队。总之，从1943年12月到1944年12月，古铁雷斯经历了240天的战斗。1944年12月4日，第一支特种部队被终止，因为难以找到这样一支精锐部队的替代者，需要更大的师级部队作战；66年后，两人仍然结婚。古铁雷斯开始教书，1990年以校长的身份退休。“你们都在捍卫我的自由，”古铁雷斯对第一届SFG（a）士兵说，“我祝你们世界上一切顺利。”
35,A1 shares proposed promotion changes with Peterson officers,"PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. C If you threw a salt water fish and a fresh water fish into the same tank, one would thrive and the other would struggle. 

Ever since the Air Force became a military service, officers in the line of the Air Force promotion category have been in the same tank when it comes to promotion. However, Air Force Manpower, Personnel and Services (A1) is proposing that officers be divided into separate tanks to give them the best chance to thrive within the conditions of their career field. 

Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Manpower and Reserve Affairs Shon Manasco along with several other members of A1 and Air Force Personnel Center visited Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado, Tuesday to explain the proposed LAF promotion category reconfiguration and how it could affect the base’s officers. 

Col. Kelly Sams, senior military assistant to Manasco, explained that in the past there were members of more than 40 Air Force specialty codes competing against one another for promotions. With the new proposed system, those AFSCs would be divided into six tanks and officers would only compete for promotion against others in their respective category. 

“This initiative isn’t so much about fixing something that’s broken,” Sams said. “Rather it’s more about looking forward and embracing the opportunity to enhance the development of our officers of the future.” 

The proposed categories include air operations and special warfare, space operations, nuclear and missile operations, information warfare, combat support, and force modernization. 

“The line of the Air Force category has worked well and has produced the leaders that we have today,” Sams said. “However, the broad nature of this category with all of the specialties within has led officers down a similar development path. A path that has proven successful at promotion boards but may sometimes lead to sub-optimized development.”

Along with the promotion category reconfiguration, Sams said that career field managers across all AFSCs have been working to develop career field briefs that outline key experiences for each level within an AFSC and help define what Air Force leaders value and expect of their officers. Once completed, these briefs will be available to all officers on the MyPers website. 

“We don’t have a shortage of great officers,” Manasco said. “But think of how many more great officers we could have if there were a little more flexibility in that path.”",2019/7/9,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/330933/a1-shares-proposed-promotion-changes-with-peterson-officers,"COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国科罗拉多州斯普林斯,A1与Peterson高级职员分享提议的晋升变动,科罗拉多州彼得森空军基地――如果你把一条咸水鱼和一条淡水鱼扔进同一个鱼缸，一条会茁壮成长，另一条会挣扎。自从空军成为兵役以来，空军晋升类别的军官在晋升方面一直处于同一个阵营。然而，空军人力、人事和服务部（A1）建议将军官分成不同的坦克，以使他们在其职业领域的条件下获得最佳发展机会。美国空军负责人力和预备役事务的助理秘书长肖恩・马纳斯科（Shon Manasco）与A1和空军人事中心的其他几名成员周二访问了科罗拉多州彼得森空军基地，解释拟议的LAF升级类别重组，以及这将如何影响该基地的军官。Manasco高级军事助理Kelly Sams上校解释说，过去有40多个空军专业代码的成员相互竞争晋升。根据新提议的系统，这些战地特种部队将分为六辆坦克，军官们只会与各自类别的其他坦克竞争晋升。萨姆斯说：“这项计划并不是为了修复一些坏掉的东西。”。“相反，这更多的是展望未来，抓住机遇，加强未来军官的发展。”拟议的类别包括空中作战和特种战、太空作战、核与导弹作战、信息战、作战支援和部队现代化。萨姆斯说：“空军类别的产品线运作良好，产生了我们今天的领导者。”。“然而，这一类别的广泛性质以及内部的所有专业，使警官们走上了类似的发展道路。这条道路在晋升董事会上被证明是成功的，但有时可能导致次级优化发展。”随着晋升类别的重新配置，Sams表示，所有空军司令部的职业领域经理一直在努力制定职业领域简报，概述空军司令部各级别的关键经验，并帮助确定空军领导人对军官的价值和期望。一旦完成，这些简报将在MyPers网站上提供给所有官员。马纳斯科说：“我们并不缺少优秀的军官。”。“但想想看，如果在这条道路上有多一点灵活性，我们还能拥有多少优秀的军官。”

41,"Team MPS, getting it right","The 341st Force Support Squadron military personnel section received the 2015 A1 Gerrit D. Foster, Jr. Outstanding Military Personnel Program Award.

This is an Air Force level award focused on team or program performance determined by outstanding contributions and commitment to excellence in serving Airmen and their families.

Malmstrom has won the award for the second time in three years.

“The Gerrit D. Foster, Jr. Award recognizes the best MPS in the Air Force,” said Ken Sylva, 341st FSS military personnel section chief. “It validates the hard work our team puts forward, and affirms Malmstrom is getting the best personnel service the Air Force has to offer. MPS takes care of personnel business so Airmen can focus on their primary jobs. That’s a win for whole team.”

According to Sylva, MPS submitted a package of achievements to compete against 82 other bases and came out victorious.

“The success is due to the team’s understanding of their role in the wing mission, and an environment where people are free to innovate,” said Sylva. 

There are a number of factors involved when gauging the success of an MPS. Malmstrom consistently rated near best in every category in 2015.  

MPS knocked the competition out of the park by successfully and efficiently handling the most important pieces of information in an Airman’s personnel records including personnel reliability program requirements, permanent change of station processes and handling duty orders.

Malmstrom also took charge of the assignment incentive pay system by accomplishing a 96 percent completion rate only one month into the program’s inception. This program not only critically impacted the 341st Missile Wing but the nuclear enterprise as well by improving force conditions for missile maintainers and security forces Airmen with special duty assignment incentive pay due to field deployments.

The Air Force goal for MPS is to have an 80 percent timeliness competition rate.

Malmstrom achieved 98 percent.

For Malmstrom’s MPS of approximately 20 Airmen, this win is becoming a trend.

“We have a very young crew of 23 members over here, not just in age, but in experience,” said Sylva. “Our Airmen are stepping outside of themselves and using their motivation to provide Malmstrom in a positive and impactful way.” 

At the 341st MW, the MPS is comprised of three sub-sections including customer service, force management and career development. 

These sections handle various critical stages on the human resources side of an Airman’s service including in processing, promotions, temporary assignments, permanent change of station and discharge from service.

Staff Sgt. Anais Lopez Quinones, 341st FSS career development supervisor for outbound assignments, says that her role as an MPS Airmen is critical in taking care of all Airmen at Malmstrom “face-to-face.” 

“I help people PCS out of the base, to make their transition smoother,” said Lopez Quinones. “It’s good to have someone for guidance, to have that one person who can answer all their PCS questions.”

According to Sylva, MPS is open 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, no exception other than wing-wide closures. 

“We have a great team,” said Lopez Quinones. “We all work toward one goal: providing the best customer service. We all do our best and give more than one hundred percent. MPS Airmen strive for the best.”",2016/7/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/204530/team-mps-getting-right,"MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE, MT, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国蒙特州马尔姆斯特罗姆空军基地,下议院议员，准备好了吗,第341部队支援中队军事人员科收到了2015 A1 Gerrit D.Foster，Jr.杰出军事人员计划奖。这是一个空军级别的奖项，重点关注团队或计划绩效，由杰出贡献和对优秀服务飞行员及其家人的承诺决定。马尔姆斯特罗姆三年来第二次获得该奖项。“Gerrit D.Foster，Jr.奖表彰空军中最优秀的议员，”第341 FSS军事人事科科长Ken Sylva说。“它验证了我们团队所做的艰苦工作，并确认马尔姆斯特罗姆正在获得空军所能提供的最佳人事服务。国会议员负责人事事务，使飞行员能够专注于他们的主要工作。这是整个团队的胜利。”根据西尔瓦的说法，议员们提交了一份与82个其他基地竞争的一揽子成就，并最终获胜。“这一成功归功于团队对他们在联队任务中的角色的理解，以及人们可以自由创新的环境。”Sylva说。衡量MPS的成功与否涉及到许多因素。马尔姆斯特罗姆在2015年的每个类别中都被评为近乎最佳。MPS成功、高效地处理了飞行员人事记录中最重要的信息，包括人员可靠性p程序要求、永久性改变电站流程和处理值班命令。马尔姆斯特罗姆还负责派遣激励薪酬体系，在项目开始一个月内完成了96%的完成率。该项目不仅对341导弹联队产生了重大影响，而且对核企业也产生了重大影响导弹维修人员和安全部队飞行员的流动部队条件，以及由于现场部署而获得的特殊任务分配奖励薪酬。MPS的空军目标是拥有80%的及时性竞争率。马尔姆斯特罗姆实现了98%。对于马尔姆斯特罗姆的大约20名飞行员的MPS来说，这一胜利正在成为一种趋势。“我们这里有23名非常年轻的机组成员，不仅是年龄，而且是经验，”西尔瓦说。“我们的飞行员正在走出自我，利用他们的动机以积极有效的方式提供马尔姆斯特罗姆。”在341MW，MPS由三个子部门组成，包括客户服务、部队管理和职业发展。这些部门处理飞行员服务人力资源方面的各个关键阶段，包括处理、晋升、临时任务、永久换岗和退役。工作人员安娜斯・洛佩斯・奎诺内斯中士，341FSS出外任务职业发展主管，说她作为MPS飞行员的角色对于“面对面”照顾马尔姆斯特罗姆的所有飞行员至关重要。“我帮助人们离开基地，让他们的过渡更顺利，”洛佩斯・奎诺内斯说。“有人来指导，有一个人能回答他们电脑上的所有问题，这很好。”根据西尔瓦的说法，国会议员周一到周五上午7:30到下午4:30开放，除了全联队停赛外，也不例外。“我们有一个很棒的团队，”洛佩兹・奎诺内斯说。“我们都朝着一个目标努力：提供最好的客户服务。我们都尽力而为，付出了100%以上。MPS飞行员力求做到最好。”

43,Idaho Joins New York for A-10 Live Fire,"FORT DRUM, N.Y., (Sept. 26, 2018) ― More than 12 Airmen assigned to the 274th Air Support Operations Squadron, New York Air National Guard, called in live fire from A-10 Thunderbolt IIs during training scenarios at Ft. Drum, Sept. 18-20, 2018. 

To meet training requirements, the 124th Fighter Wing, Gowen Field Air National Guard Base, Idaho, provided four of the aircraft for the joint terminal attack controllers to train with. With 30 mm rotary cannons, white phosphorus rockets and 500 pound bombs at their disposal, the JTACs coordinated several attacks on stationary targets.

“We were controlling close air support, we had A-10s overhead,” said Senior Airman Blaine Moore, a JTAC assigned to the 274th ASOS. “We were being a liaison on the ground to coordinate with the pilots so they could deliver close air support on enemy targets.” 

The targets may not have been truly enemies, but to train as they fight is essential for keeping their skills sharp. On a battlefield, it is a JTAC that is going to ensure that air support delivers the desired results.

“This type of training is extremely important for us because it‘s hands on training,” said Moore. “It’s what we’re actually going to be doing downrange so that when the time comes and we have to save and protect friendly ground forces, we can coordinate and provide these ordinances in a safe manner.”

Playing such a vital role on the battlefield, the Airman of the 274th ASOS spend countless days perfecting these skills. Success for them is measured in their ability to save and protect others.

“Our role is extremely crucial in a downrange environment,” said Moore. “Without us on the ground to liaison with the assets in the air and the ground commander, there is not necessarily a connection between the two.”

A JTAC is specially trained to be able to communicate with the various aircraft of the U.S. military that provide air support. They plan and coordinate missions to have ground targets engaged, and then control the aircraft to execute the mission. U.S. and coalition forces can utilize JTACs in ways that can drastically change the face of a battle. 

“Any chance we get, we take full advantage of it and take our training to next level,” said Moore, describing the opportunity to train with live fire from aircraft.  “We were in full scenario the entire time utilizing every piece of equipment that we possibly could, that we don’t get to use outside of a firing range.”

The week of training at Ft. Drum ended as a success with all training goals achieved. For the Airmen of the 274th ASOS, the job may not be easy but it is exactly how they want to serve their country. 

“It feels awesome, it’s a lot of hard work but it’s very rewarding,” said Moore.",2018/9/27,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/294606/idaho-joins-new-york-10-live-fire,"FORT DRUM, NY, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国纽约州德拉姆堡,爱达荷州加入纽约A-10实弹射击,纽约州德拉姆堡（2018年9月26日）-纽约州国民警卫队第274空中支援行动中队的12名以上飞行员在德拉姆堡进行训练时，从A-10 Thunderbolt IIs呼叫实弹射击，2018年9月18日至20日。为了满足训练要求，爱达荷州戈文空军国民警卫队基地第124战斗机联队提供了四架飞机供联合终端攻击控制员训练。在30毫米旋转加农炮、白磷火箭和500磅炸弹的支配下，JTAC协调了对固定目标的几次攻击。“我们控制着近距离空中支援，我们头顶上有A-10，”分配给第274 ASOS的JTAC高级飞行员布莱恩・摩尔（Blaine Moore）说。“我们在地面充当联络人，与飞行员协调，以便他们能够对敌人目标提供近距离空中支援。”这些目标可能不是真正的敌人，但在战斗中进行训练对于保持他们的技能至关重要。在战场上，JTAC将确保空中支援达到预期效果。“这种类型的训练对我们来说非常重要，因为这是动手训练，”摩尔说。“这是我们实际上将要做的事情，以便当时间到来时，我们必须拯救和保护友好的地面部队，我们可以安全地协调和提供这些法令。”在战场上扮演着如此重要的角色，第274 ASO的飞行员花了无数天来完善这些技能。他们的成功取决于他们拯救和保护他人的能力。摩尔说：“我们的角色在下行环境中至关重要。”。“没有我们在地面与空中资产和地面指挥官的联系，两者之间就不一定有联系。”JTAC经过专门训练，能够与提供空中支援的美军各种飞机进行通信。他们计划和协调任务，让地面目标参与，然后控制飞机执行任务。美国和联军可以利用联合战术指挥系统，从而彻底改变战斗面貌。摩尔说：“只要有机会，我们就会充分利用它，把我们的训练提高到一个新的水平。”他描述了利用飞机实弹进行训练的机会。“我们一直在充分利用我们可能使用的每一件设备，而这些设备我们无法在射程之外使用。”在鼓堡训练的一周圆满结束，所有训练目标都实现了。对于第274届美国空军司令部的飞行员来说，这项工作可能并不容易，但这正是他们想要为国家服务的方式。摩尔说：“这感觉棒极了，这是一项艰巨的工作，但它是非常有益的。”。
44,AA Group to Start at NSAB,"For those struggling with alcoholism or other substance abuse, Naval Support Activity Bethesda (NSAB) Interfaith Center is set to start hosting a weekly Alcoholics Anonymous group.

The “Another Chance” AA group came about between talks that NSAB Chaplain Christilene Whalen had with AA member Dan.

“I wanted to start one for the NSAB community,” he said. “I approached the chaplain and said ‘Hey I’d love to start a meeting here.’”

“We said, ‘When?’ Whalen recalled. “It was a decision that was easy to make.”

Dan said he hopes the meetings will help service members, “Wounded Warriors” or anyone who works at NSAB and has a problem with alcoholism.

“Our primary purpose (in AA) is to stay sober and help other alcoholics achieve sobriety,” Dan said.

Whalen said the Interfaith Center’s mission rolls neatly into that of AA as both are designed to help people grow.

“AA is really important to me,” she continued. “I have a large amount of alcoholics in my family … They help not only the person who is going through it, but the family member as well. ‘Cause it’s difficult to live in a house with an alcoholic.”

Another Chance is a registered group of Alcoholics Anonymous, so people who have court requirements to attend can come and have their court cards signed. Whalen said service members can be referred to the meeting through the Drug and Alcohol Prevention Advocate.

“Sometimes those ‘voluntold’ things help people keep their jobs, keep their families and keep their lives intact,” Whalen added.

Dan said anyone is welcome to attend the group and “the only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking.”

The first Alcoholics Anonymous group is March 15 at 11:30 a.m. in the Interfaith Center basement, conference room 34, Bldg. 11.

45,3rd AA Bn celebrates the Corps’ 240th birthday,"MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. C To most, Nov. 10 is just like any other day, but for the few and the proud, it is one of the most significant days in their Corps’ history and is celebrated with pride during the Marine Corps Birthday Ball Celebration.

For 240 years the United States Marine Corps has been the nation’s force in readiness and has been called upon to support operations around the world. Each year, Marines in every clime and place pay homage to the Marine Corps’ continued dedicated service as a ready and relevant force deployed across the globe.    

Although many Marines enjoy the typical lavish Marine Corps Birthday Ball ceremonies held at venues throughout the country, others like Company A, 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 1st Marine Division, celebrated the Corps’ birthday in more austere conditions this year.

The company of Marines and Sailors celebrated the 240th birthday in the desert of Yuma Proving Grounds, Arizona to cap off a 15-day field exercise. 
  
The Marines and Sailors were in high spirits during the celebration, starting the evening off with a hot meal. Directly after, the Marines took their places around the lowered ramp of an Amphibious Assault Vehicle to hear the 13th Commandant of the Marine Corps Gen. John A. Lejeune’s birthday message and to witness the traditional cake cutting ceremony, followed by the viewing of the birthday message from the current commandant, Gen. Robert B. Neller. 

“This right here is the heart of the Marine Corps, it’s what we do,” said 1st Lt. Sean Styerwalt, the headquarters company platoon commander with 3rd AA Bn. “As Marines we get out here and get dirty and we do what we have to do. We have been out here for 15 days, so we stink and some of us are tired but it’s a great deal and it’s probably the best birthday I’ve ever been a part of.”

The Marine Corps’ birthday is a time-honored tradition when past and present generations of Marines gather to commemerate the Corps’ storied history. There are various moments within the ceremony that capture the significance of Marine Corps legacy.

The cake cutting ceremony, which can be considered the most symbolic tradition of the ceremony, symbolizes the passing of responsibility and traditions from one generation of Marines to another.    

No matter what the circumstance, Marines will set aside time to celebrate the traditions and legacy of the Marine Corps. While the celebration of the Corp’s birthday is a top priority among all commands, it never gets in the way of maintaining the readiness of its Marines.   

“I think it’s great to celebrate out in the field here in Yuma because it’s what the Corps’ roots are,” said 1st Lt. Dillon Fuston, a platoon commander with 3rd AA Bn. “Marines look pretty in their dress blues and all but when it comes down to the dirty grit of it, all Marines are here to train and to fight. It’s good that we are out here because it reminds Marines what our duties are to the nation and to each other.”   

At the end of the event, Capt. Brian Jaquitch, the company commander, expressed how proud he was of his Marines and their efforts throughout the training.     

“I’m extremely proud of the company,” Jaquitch said. “I couldn’t be more proud of the way these Marines trained and the skills they showed as a crew. The ceremony was pretty much the culminating event, so it was a great way to end the training portion of this exercise.”

Despite the layers of dirt and grease stained within their utilities and coveralls, the lack of showers and stomachs growling for a home-cooked meal, the Marines and Sailors successfully completed their training and showed they haven’t forgotten where they came from, remembering the long line of heroes who came before them.",2015/11/10,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/181958/3rd-aa-bn-celebrates-corps-240th-birthday,"YUMA PROVING GROUND, AZ, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国亚利桑那州尤马试验场,第三届美国海军陆战队庆祝陆军陆战队240岁生日,加利福尼亚州彭德尔顿海军陆战队大本营――对大多数人来说，11月10日就像其他任何一天一样，但对少数人和骄傲的人来说，这是美国海军陆战队历史上最重要的日子之一，在海军陆战队生日舞会上，人们自豪地庆祝这一天。240年来，美国海军陆战队一直是国家的战备部队，并被要求支持世界各地的行动。每一年，海军陆战队在每一个地区和地方都要向海军陆战队致敬，他们作为一支部署在全球各地的随时准备好的相关部队，继续奉献自己的服务。虽然许多海军陆战队士兵喜欢在全国各地的场地举行的海军陆战队生日舞会，但其他人，如海军陆战队第一师第三突击两栖营A连，今年，海军陆战队和水手们在亚利桑那州尤马试验场的沙漠中庆祝了240岁的生日，结束了为期15天的野战演习。海军陆战队和水手们在庆祝活动中兴高采烈，晚上以一顿热饭开始。紧接着，海军陆战队士兵们在一辆两栖突击车的下降坡道周围就座，聆听海军陆战队第13任司令约翰・A・勒琼将军的生日祝词，见证传统的蛋糕切割仪式，然后观看现任司令罗伯特・B・内勒将军的生日祝词。“这里是海军陆战队的核心，我们就是这样做的，”第三机管局Bn总部连队排长肖恩・斯泰尔沃尔特中尉说。“作为海军陆战队，我们来到这里，弄脏衣服，做我们必须做的事情。我们在这里已经呆了15天了，所以我们很臭，有些人很累，但这是一个非常棒的生日，这可能是我参加过的最好的生日。”海军陆战队的生日是一个由来已久的传统，过去和现在的几代海军陆战队成员齐聚一堂，共同讲述海军陆战队的传奇历史。仪式中有许多时刻体现了海军陆战队遗产的重要性。蛋糕切割仪式被认为是仪式中最具象征意义的传统，象征着责任和传统从一代海军陆战队传递到另一代海军陆战队。无论在什么情况下，海军陆战队都会留出时间来庆祝海军陆战队的传统和遗产。虽然庆祝该公司的生日是所有司令部的首要任务，但它从未妨碍海军陆战队保持战备状态。“我认为在尤马的战场上庆祝是一件很好的事情，因为这是军团的根基所在，”第三陆军旅排长Dillon Fuston中尉说。“海军陆战队穿着蓝色礼服看起来很漂亮，但归根结底，所有的海军陆战队都是来训练和战斗的。我们来到这里很好，因为这提醒了海军陆战队我们对国家和彼此的责任。”活动结束时，连长布赖恩・贾奎奇上尉，表达了他对自己的海军陆战队以及他们在整个训练过程中的努力感到多么自豪。“我为这家公司感到非常自豪，”贾奎奇说。“我对这些海军陆战队的训练方式和他们作为一名船员所表现出的技能感到无比自豪。仪式几乎是一个高潮，因此这是结束这次演习训练部分的一个很好的方式。”尽管他们的工具和工作服上沾满了层层污垢和油脂，由于没有淋浴和肚子咕噜咕噜地咕噜咕噜地吃一顿家常饭，海军陆战队和水手们成功地完成了他们的训练，并表明他们没有忘记他们来自哪里，记住了在他们之前的一长串英雄。
46,Cadets on board- 2nd AA Bn Marines give demonstration,"CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. - Cadets with the Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps unit at Cary High School, Cary, North Carolina, visited Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, March 31, 2015, to expand their knowledge of military occupational specialties.

The cadets teamed up with Marines from 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 2nd Marine Division for hands-on experience with amphibious assault vehicles.

“Many of our students are attracted to the military; that’s why they join JROTC,” said Lt. Col. Wesley L. Feight, the senior naval science instructor at Cary High School. “This is a way to expose them to more pieces of the military puzzle and help them make sense of things.” 

The cadets were given the chance to experience the gas chamber and interact with a military working dog unit. The trip also allowed time for cadets to participate in the Indoor Simulated Marksmanship Trainer before returning home.

At home, the cadets have the opportunity to participate in competitive drill, marksmanship and color-guard services, and they are heavily involved in community service.

“My favorite part of JROTC is gaining snapshots of the military lifestyle and the opportunity to see different jobs before I commit to one,” said Brendan Kearns, a senior at Cary HS and the commanding officer for the school’s NJROTC program. 

Kearns plans to attend college and participate in their ROTC program before joining the military.

“For me, the highlight is having them interact with Marines,” Feight said. “I think they gain more from talking with the people, seeing what Marines are really like and gaining that level of familiarity and appreciation.”",2015/3/31,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/158827/cadets-board-2nd-aa-bn-marines-give-demonstration,"CAMP LEJEUNE, NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国北卡罗来纳州勒琼营,船上学员-第二架AA Bn海军陆战队进行演示,北卡罗来纳州勒琼营――2015年3月31日，北卡罗来纳州卡里高中海军初级预备役军官训练团的学员参观了海军陆战队勒琼营基地，以扩大他们对军事职业专业的了解。学员们与第二突击两栖营的海军陆战队进行了合作，海军陆战队第二师，体验两栖攻击车。卡里高中高级海军科学讲师韦斯利・L・费特中校说：“我们的许多学生都被军队吸引，这就是他们加入JROTC的原因。”。“这是一种让他们接触更多军事谜题并帮助他们理解事物的方法。”学员们有机会体验毒气室，并与军事工作犬部队互动。这次旅行还让学员们有时间在回家之前参加室内模拟射击教练。在家里，学员们有机会参加竞争性训练、射击和护色服务，并积极参与社区服务。“我在JROTC最喜欢的部分是获得军队生活方式的快照，以及在我投入工作之前看到不同工作的机会，”Cary HS的大四学生、学校NJROTC项目的指挥官Brendan Kearns说。Kearns计划在参军前上大学并参加他们的ROTC项目。“对我来说，最重要的是让他们与海军陆战队互动，”费特说。“我认为他们从与人们交谈、了解海军陆战队的真实面目以及获得那种熟悉和欣赏中获得了更多。”
47,Digging deep- Marines with 2nd AA Bn. conduct avalanche training,"BRIDGEPORT, Calif. C Marines and sailors from across II Marine Expeditionary Force and 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade took on the Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport, Calif., as part of their preparation for Exercise Cold Response 16 in March.

The exercise will feature military training including maritime, land and air operations that underscore NATO's ability to defend against any threat in any environment.

Marines with 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion worked against the clock as they raced to save a notional avalanche victim during scenario-based training at the training center Jan. 20, 2016.

The Marines and sailors conducted multiple training events throughout the 10-day course in order to acclimatize themselves to the weather conditions they’ll face in Norway during Cold Response.

Sgt. Keith Carman, a squad leader with Alpha Company, 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion, led the charge as his Marines rushed to save the notional victim.

“We had two classes leading up to the actual scenario that gave us an insight to the training ahead,” said Carman. He added the classes gave his Marines a chance to learn more about the gear and eventually get their hands on the equipment.

Cpl. Tristan Morrison, a fire team leader with the company, joined the Marines in the search for the notional casualty. The Marines formed a probe line in which they stood side-by-side and canvassed the area of the suspected location of the casualty. The Marines probed with aluminum rods marked at every foot to indicate the depth of the snow, which also helped locate a rescue dummy. 

“The Marine behind the probe line gives you the commands on where to probe and when,” said Morrison. “While he’s doing that, he’s looking at inconsistencies in the probes and the one probing is getting a feel for what the probe is hitting.”

With little experience operating in mountainous regions, Carman said his Marines performed well and he feels confident in their capabilities.

“The Marines did great,” said Carman. ”We beat our timeline to get to the landing zone and found the victim within a reasonable timeframe regardless of the outside factors affecting our movements.”

By working through scenario-based training, the Marines better prepared themselves the challenges they’ll face working alongside their NATO counterparts during the Norwegian winter.",2016/1/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/187399/digging-deep-marines-with-2nd-aa-bn-conduct-avalanche-training,"BRIDGEPORT, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],布里奇波特，加利福尼亚州，美国,挖掘深-海军陆战队与第二个AA Bn。进行雪崩训练,加利福尼亚州布里奇波特――来自第二海军陆战队远征军和第二海军陆战队远征旅的海军陆战队和水手参加了位于加利福尼亚州布里奇波特的山地战争训练中心，作为他们为3月第16次冷反应演习做准备的一部分。这次演习将以军事训练为特色，包括海上，强调北约在任何环境下抵御任何威胁的能力的陆上和空中行动。1月20日，在训练中心进行的基于情景的训练中，海军陆战队与第二突击两栖动物营分秒必争，争分夺秒地赶赴拯救一名名义上的雪崩受害者，2016年。在为期10天的课程中，海军陆战队和水手们进行了多次训练，以适应寒冷响应期间他们将在挪威面临的天气条件。中士。基思・卡曼（Keith Carman）是第二突击两栖动物营阿尔法连的一名班长，他带领海军陆战队冲锋去营救名义上的受害者。卡曼说：“我们上了两门课，了解了实际情况，让我们了解了未来的训练。”。他补充说，这些课程让他的海军陆战队有机会学习更多关于装备的知识，并最终掌握装备。Cpl。特里斯坦・莫里森是该公司的消防队队长，他加入了海军陆战队，搜寻所谓的伤亡人员。海军陆战队组成了一条探测线，他们并排站在探测线内，仔细搜索疑似伤员的位置。海军陆战队用铝棒探测每一只脚，以指示雪的深度，这也有助于找到一个救援假人。莫里森说：“探测线后面的陆战队员会告诉你探测的地点和时间。”。“当他这样做的时候，他在观察探测器中的不一致性，而其中一个探测是对探测器击中的物体的感觉。”卡曼说，由于在山区作战的经验很少，他的海军陆战队表现良好，他对他们的能力充满信心。“海军陆战队做得很好，”卡曼说我们按照时间表到达着陆区，在合理的时间内找到了受害者，而不考虑影响我们行动的外部因素。”通过基于情景的训练，海军陆战队更好地准备了他们将在挪威冬季与北约同行一道面临的挑战。
48,From sea to land- 2nd AA Battalion maintains amphibious readiness,"CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. - The whisper of engines slowly grew louder until it was a roar over the crash of waves on sand. Dots on the horizon, dwarfed by the silhouette of the USS Whidbey Island, crawled along in the ocean until the distinct shapes of assault amphibious vehicles formed and appeared larger than the landing ship in the distance.

The AAVs left spouts of water and plumes of white and black smoke in their wakes, and growled as tracks met the beach and the vehicles rushed forward. The Marines had landed as approximately 40 Marines with 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, conducted amphibious operation training aboard Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, July 15C16. 

“This is the first time we’re doing this together as a platoon,” said Cpl. Kyle Severt, an AAV crew chief with 3rd Platoon, Bravo Company. “It’s important because our job is to keep the Marine Corps amphibious. We have to practice in the water to be good at it because this is one of the most dangerous things that we do.”

The exercise began with the platoon’s 10 vehicles plunging into the Atlantic Ocean and practicing various maneuvers. The Marines conducted landing drills several times before heading several miles out to sea to board the Whidbey Island and complete their well deck training.

After a night on the ship, the Marines again boarded their vehicles and splashed into the ocean, making one final beach assault. 

“The Marine Corps is amphibious by nature,” said Lance Cpl. Matthew Carstensen, an AAV crew chief with the unit. “We hit beaches and we hit with speed and ferocity. That’s our job and if we don’t get that training, how is the infantry going to rely on us to get them to the beach safely?”

The use of amphibious operations allows Marines to land personnel and equipment without the need of secure aircraft landing zones. The AAVs have the capability to carry personnel and supplies, as well as provide their own firepower and security.

“We are the first wave to hit the beach,” said 1st Lt. Ian Budge, the commander of 3rd Platoon. “AAVs let us project power from any kind of naval platform that can travel the world. AAV operators are the only Marines who will actively practice this and we will be the direct advisors for ground assaults.” 

Naval-based assaults are not the only option the military utilizes to move troops into hostile territory, but they can be more practical in certain situations. Direct assaults from the sea carry less risk of being surrounded than inserting personnel and equipment in land controlled by an enemy with aircraft, and allow for more direct supply lines.

“Aircraft have great potential to go inland over long distances,” Budge said. “AAVs, however, are the primary means for establishing a foothold on any land where we don’t already have a presence. Constant training with AAVs is important for us so that if anything kicks off, we’re ready to answer the call.”",2015/7/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/170597/sea-land-2nd-aa-battalion-maintains-amphibious-readiness,"CAMP LEJEUNE, NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国北卡罗来纳州勒琼营,从海上到陆地-第二防空营保持两栖战备状态,北卡罗来纳州勒琼营地――引擎的低语声慢慢变大，直到海浪拍打沙滩发出轰鸣声。地平线上的小点与美国惠德比号航空母舰的轮廓相形见绌，它们在海洋中爬行，直到两栖攻击车的不同形状形成，并且看起来比远处的登陆舰还要大。AAV在尾迹中留下了水柱和黑白烟羽，当铁轨与海滩相撞，车辆冲向前方时，它咆哮着。7月15日至16日，海军陆战队第二师第二突击两栖营约40名陆战队士兵在北卡罗来纳州勒琼营进行两栖作战训练。“这是我们第一次作为一个排一起做这件事，”布拉沃连第三排AAV机组长凯尔・塞维特下士说。“这很重要，因为我们的工作是让海军陆战队保持两栖。我们必须在水中练习，才能擅长这项工作，因为这是我们所做的最危险的事情之一。”演习开始于该排的10辆车冲入大西洋并练习各种机动。海军陆战队进行了多次登陆演习，然后出海数英里登上惠德比岛并完成井底甲板训练。在船上呆了一个晚上后，海军陆战队再次登上车辆并溅入大海，进行了最后一次海滩突击。“海军陆战队本质上是两栖的，”该部队AAV机组长兰斯・马修・卡斯滕森下士说。“我们袭击海滩，我们以速度和凶猛袭击。这是我们的工作，如果我们没有得到训练，步兵将如何依靠我们将他们安全带到海滩？”两栖作战的使用使海军陆战队能够在不需要安全飞机着陆区的情况下降落人员和设备。AAV有能力运送人员和物资，并提供自己的火力和安全保障。第三排指挥官伊恩・巴奇中尉说：“我们是第一批登陆海滩的人。”。“AAV让我们可以从任何一种可以周游世界的海军平台上投射力量。AAV操作员是唯一会积极实践这一点的海军陆战队，我们将是地面攻击的直接顾问。”海军基地攻击不是军方将部队转移到敌对领土的唯一选择，但在某些情况下，它们可能更实用。来自海上的直接攻击比在敌人用飞机控制的陆地上插入人员和设备所带来的被包围的风险要小，并且允许更直接的补给线。“飞机有很大的潜力可以远距离进入内陆，”Budge说。“然而，AAV是在我们还没有存在的任何土地上建立立足点的主要手段。AAV的持续训练对我们来说很重要，这样，如果有什么事情开始，我们就可以随时响应。”
49,2nd AA Bn becomes first unit to negotiate Camp Lejeune’s new Leadership Reaction Course,"U.S. Marines with 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion (2nd AA Bn), 2nd Marine Division, took on a challenge as the first unit to navigate the newly-opened Leadership Reaction Course (LRC) on Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, Jan. 7, 2020.

More than 60 Marines with 2nd AA Bn maneuvered through four different obstacles, some leading the path to victory and other to defeat.

“Marines gain a lot from this training and most importantly they gain the ability to think in a time constrained, stressful situation,” said Staff Sgt. Donald McBee Jr., the mine countermeasure platoon sergeant with 2nd AA Bn. “There are frictions that are thrown at them, having to think under pressure, giving them the ability to problem solve on the move.”

The Marines divided into 12 teams of five, rotating through the different obstacles, each requiring critical thinking and problem solving skills to maneuver. Each station consists of its own rules and objectives: red surfaces couldn’t be touched, only the materials provided could be used and all Marines have to make it through the obstacle safely.  The team also had to complete each station in less than 15 minutes.

At each obstacle, a new Marine was given an opportunity to lead by becoming the fire team leader for the group. That Marine’s responsibility was to form a plan, and organize and direct the Marines on hand to solve the obstacle in the time allotted. The objective of Marine Corps leadership is to develop the leadership qualities of Marines to enable them to assume progressively greater responsibilities. Regardless of rank, every Marine must be prepared to lead.

“I gained a lot of experience about critical thinking that I wouldn’t usually get from my day to day work,” said Cpl. Arthur Lesso, a metal worker with 2nd AA Bn. “I most definitely would do it again. It helps leaders and people who wouldn’t be leaders to flex that muscle and just figure out a problem that doesn’t have an easy solution.”

According to McBee, 2nd AA Bn participated in the LRC as their Back in the Saddle training to start 2020 off right. The goal of BITS is to refocus Marines after the holiday and prepare them for the year ahead.
 
“The LRC is absolutely great training, and I am glad they brought it back,” McBee said. “I guarantee that we will be coming back to do follow-on training here.”",2020/1/7,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/359238/2nd-aa-bn-becomes-first-unit-negotiate-camp-lejeunes-new-leadership-reaction-course,"CAMP LEJEUNE, NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国北卡罗来纳州勒琼营,第二个AA Bn成为第一个谈判Lejeune营新领导层反应课程的单位,2020年1月7日，海军陆战队第二师第二突击两栖营（第二AA Bn）的美国海军陆战队作为第一个在北卡罗莱纳州海军陆战队大本营Lejeune新开设的领导反应课程（LRC）中航行的部队，接受了一项挑战。60多名海军陆战队第二AA Bn通过了四个不同的障碍，海军陆战队士兵从这次训练中获益匪浅，最重要的是，他们能够在时间紧迫、压力巨大的情况下思考问题，陆军中士唐纳德・麦克比（Donald McBee Jr.）说，他是第二海军陆战队士兵的地雷对抗排中士。“有摩擦抛向他们，必须在压力下思考，让他们能够在行动中解决问题。”海军陆战队分成12个小组，每组5人，轮流穿越不同的障碍，每个小组都需要批判性思维和解决问题的技能来操作。每个空间站都有自己的规则和目标：红色表面不能触摸，只能使用提供的材料，所有的海军陆战队成员必须安全地通过障碍物。小组还必须在不到15分钟的时间内完成每一站。在每一个障碍物上，一名新的海军陆战队队员都有机会成为小组的消防队长。海军陆战队的职责是制定一个计划，组织和指挥现有的海军陆战队在规定的时间内解决障碍。海军陆战队领导的目标是培养海军陆战队的领导素质，使他们能够逐步承担更大的责任。无论军衔高低，每个海军陆战队员都必须做好领导的准备。“我在批判性思维方面获得了很多经验，这是我在日常工作中通常得不到的，”第二航空局Bn的金属工人阿瑟・莱索下士说。“我肯定会再做一次。这有助于领导者和那些不想成为领导者的人锻炼肌肉，并找出一个不容易解决的问题。”McBee说，第二位AA Bn作为他们的后备马鞍训练参加了LRC，准备从2020年开始。BITS的目标是在假期后重新关注海军陆战队，为下一年做好准备。“LRC绝对是很棒的训练，我很高兴他们回来了，”McBee说。“我保证我们会回来这里进行后续培训。”
50,Then and Now- African American ERG’s Black History Celebration Ceremony,"Lift Every Voice and Sing, adopted in 1919 by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as the “Black National Anthem,” was a fitting opening song for Norfolk Naval Shipyard’s (NNSY) African American Employee Resource Group’s (AA-ERG) 3rd annual Black History Celebration Feb. 20. Located near the waterfront for accessibility, the workforce was graced with the beautifully full voices of engineers Brian Darden (Code 105) and Andre Johnson (Code 900T) when they sang the song. Founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Zel Technologies, LLC (ZELTECH) Jack L. Ezzell Jr. was the speaker of the event. 

Born and raised in North Carolina, Ezzell discussed his journey of joining the United States Air Force and later becoming a successful African American entrepreneur. Moving onto the struggles and prejudices he faced along the way, he made it clear that his intention was not to shame anyone for something others did long ago, but rather to help people understand the present, in lieu of his theme ‘Lest We Forget.’ “There’s a lot we can learn from examining our past,” Ezzell said. “It is useful because it can be used to understand where people are coming from today.” 

Moreover, Black History Month exists to celebrate those who came before us and paved the way for the freedoms society has now. Ezzell said, “we are here to step back and recognize the many great gifts that African Americans have brought to our nation.” 

Aligning with the shipyard’s C.O.R.E. value of Respect, Ezzell also encouraged others to listen to each other. “Engage with people of different perspectives from your own,” he urged. “Listen with kindness in your heart, not anger. If we listen to each other and treat each other with respect, we can find ways to solve the problems of today.”",2020/2/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/363808/then-and-now-african-american-ergs-black-history-celebration-ceremony,"PORTSMOUTH, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州朴茨茅斯,时过境迁――非裔美国人ERG的黑人历史庆祝仪式,1919年，全国有色人种进步协会（NAACP）将“扬声歌唱”作为“黑人国歌”，这首歌是诺福克海军造船厂（NNSY）非裔美国人员工资源小组（AA-ERG）于2月20日举行的第三届黑人历史庆祝活动的一首合适的开场歌。工作人员位于靠近海滨的无障碍地带，当他们唱这首歌时，布莱恩・达登（代码105）和安德烈・约翰逊（代码900T）的声音优美而饱满。Zel Technologies，LLC（ZELTECH）创始人兼首席执行官（CEO）Jack L.Ezzell Jr.是此次活动的发言人。在北卡罗莱纳州出生和长大的埃泽尔讲述了他加入美国空军并后来成为一名成功的非洲裔美国企业家的历程。谈到他在这一过程中所面临的斗争和偏见，他明确表示，他的意图不是让任何人为他人很久以前所做的事情感到羞耻，而是帮助人们理解现在，而不是他的主题“以免我们忘记”。埃泽尔说：“我们可以从审视过去中学到很多东西。”。“这是有用的，因为它可以用来了解人们今天从哪里来。”此外，黑人历史月的存在是为了庆祝那些走在我们前面并为社会现在的自由铺平道路的人。埃泽尔说：“我们在这里退一步，承认非洲裔美国人给我们国家带来的许多伟大礼物。”埃泽尔与造船厂的C.O.R.E.尊重价值观保持一致，并鼓励其他人相互倾听。“与你自己不同观点的人接触，”他敦促道。“用心倾听，而不是愤怒。如果我们彼此倾听，相互尊重，我们就能找到解决当今问题的方法。”
51,"Norwegian ambassador visits Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station New River","The Carolina Marine Air Ground Task Force hosted Norwegian Ambassador K?re R. Aas during his visit to North Carolina, April 22-24, 2019.

The ambassador toured Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Station New River to help ensure the relationship between Marines and Norwegians can continue to develop. 

“I always think that working in Washington D.C., you can get an impression or idea of a topic or issue but to better understand something I believe you have to come see it for yourself,” said Aas. “I’ve heard so much about the Marines and I have also spoken to the commander several times but I wanted to see with my own eyes.”

The ambassador, along with his defense attachés, began their visit at MCAS New River and met with Col. Robert Morgan, Marine Aircraft Group-29 commanding officer, before touring multiple units within the 2nd Marine Air Wing. He paid a visit to Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 366, Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 269 and Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 365.

“I have been on base for less than a day and I have learned so much,” said Aas. “To hear directly from the pilots about command and control, what can be improved as well as the conditions they operated under, it is important to me.”

The ambassador departed New River and headed toward Camp Lejeune to meet with the Lt. Gen. Robert F. Hedelund, II MEF commanding general, to discuss future training opportunities between the U.S. Marines and the Norwegian Army.

“What I heard from [Lt. Gen.] Hedelund, and his closest advisors, is the continued interest to work with Norway and learn how to operate in arctic environments. Hearing that from them personally is important and it is something I can tell my superiors about,” said Aas. “Having the Marines there on a rotational basis is important in our bilateral relationship between the United States, Norway and the Marines but also as a deterrence measure.” 

Toward the end of his visit, Aas emphasized the importance of the relationship between the Marines and Norway, elaborating on the success of Trident Juncture and the approval of the Norwegian people.

“We have to recognize that the Marines in Norway behave in a very positive manner when interacting with Norwegians. [Respect] is a two-way street and we have worked very closely together, which is why I believe it is so successful,” said Aas. “We are not only exercising [with the U.S.] in Norway, we have been standing shoulder-to-shoulder in Iraq and in Afghanistan.

In the wake of the ongoing pandemic, it was clear it would be difficult to host the ceremony like years past C so the AA-ERG took charge in developing a virtual event filmed by NNSY’s Instructional Design Center (Code 1170). 

“It was important for us to find a way to continue our annual celebration and to bring our workforce together in whatever way we could while remaining safe,” said AA-ERG Chair Michael Taylor. “Our team brainstormed ideas and decided to film the program in segments to be included in our first-ever virtual event.

His words echoed across the country, powerful statements bringing a call to action for others to do their part. With the recent civil unrest in our country, we should each remember his resounding call for equality for all and judging one by the content of their character.  If anything, Dr. King’s words are more important than ever today.” 

Minister Cartwright shared his thoughts on the dedication to service, as well as Dr. King’s legacy as someone who wasn’t afraid to challenge social inequality. “Dr. King lived his life not only for the service of himself but for the service of others. Because true service is the care and consideration one has for the need of others. When we think of the word service C in many ways it is a synonym of the word discomfort. Because true service for a cause, community, or culture causes one to have discomfort,” said Minister Cartwright. “I tell you if there is one word that is manipulative in the English dictionary C it is the word comfortable. Because being too comfortable will keep you hindered. Comfortable will stop your potential for growth. Comfortable will keep people stuck in stagnation when greatness is calling their name. Dr. King knew better than anyone to make a difference, you have to get a little uncomfortable.” 

He continued, “I hope that we all can strive to get a little uncomfortable, to be an agitator, to make a difference - whether it be to feed every child or ensure justice across our land until there is equality for all. Think of it like a washing machine. When you have a stain that is too great, you need some agitation to remove it. Be the agitator. Help make a difference.” 

Capt. Wolfson added, “At America’s Shipyard, we work together as a team leveraging our ideas and our innovations in ship repair and modernization. We are nearly 11,000-members strong and each one of us has an important role to play in maximizing the mission. We are a melting pot of different cultures, ethnicities, genders, races, and more C all coming together to support the U.S. Navy. We are all unique individuals who are key players on the great team that make our shipyard so great. It’s up to every one of us to take care of one another at our shipyard C showing each other the utmost respect and striving each day to do the right thing. We truly are ONE team serving ONE mission.”

53,"Airstreams Renewables, Inc. opens first campus on a Marine Corps base","Earlier this week, 13 Marines started their first day of class at Airstreams Renewables, Inc. (ARI), aa skill bridge program to help military service members transition into a civilian career after their service. 
“You hear a lot of companies say ‘veteran friendly’ but what does that really mean if you don’t have the proof,” said Brandon Richardson, training specialist. “Airstreams does that. We give training and skills to these transitioning service members to get them certified and make connections with employers.”
ARI is a seven-week course with several modules in the curriculum that leave service members certified in 12 different areas of work. Certifications include  authorized climber and rescue, electrical metering safety, CADWELD and several others.
“Everybody loves service members,” said Andrew Mejia, training supervisor. “We just want to provide the service member, that they already love, with some nationally recognized and nationally accredited skills.”
ARI currently has seven campuses with six of those on military installations.
“This grand opening is our first campus aboard a Marine Corps base,” Mejia said. “They are predominantly for service members who will be leaving the Marine Corps. We have another campus which is also our corporate headquarters out of Tehachapi, California. This is where we send our veterans, civilians and dependents.”
As these transitioning service members complete this course, they will also be placed with a job before the end of their seven weeks.
“The ‘making a connection’ is my favorite part of the company,” Mejia said. “It is called our career placement. Once you are a part of the Airstreams family, you are always a part of the Airstreams family.”
Service members that complete this course at ARI will have a lifetime of help. ARI will continue to go over resumes and mock interviews as well as continue with job placement years after course completion. 
“We don’t give them anything, it is a learning process,” said Richardson. “We’re a family for life, so as a graduate, you can come back to the career placement so that we can help you with what you need toget that next job.”

54,Norfolk Naval Shipyard’s African American Employee Resource Group’s 2nd Annual Open Mic- How Did I Make It?,"As the last of many events celebrating African American History Month in 2020, Norfolk Naval Shipyard’s (NNSY) African American Employee Resource Group (AA-ERG) held its second annual open microphone session. This year, the panel featured five senior level leaders from the Department of Defense (DoD), Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), Office of Civilian Human Resources (OCHR), and Senior Executive Service (SES) members from Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA). 

The topic was “How Did I Make It?” The panelists answered questions from the audience about what they have learned from their journeys to get to where they are now professionally. Many questions were asked, but the main takeaways for the attendees were these: bring something to the table, keep going, and do not be afraid to ask for help. 

Bring Something to the Table 

Division Head of Human Resources at OCHR Norfolk Operations Center, who services Fleet Forces Command and Commander Navy Reserve Force Danielle Dutton said, “One of the biggest challenges is making sure you are regularly evaluating your skillset. When you are looking for an opportunity, make sure that you look at your resume, that it really conveys everything you do and have done, and that you take credit for what you do on a daily basis.”  

One recurring subject was the value of providing solutions to a problem. SES Deputy Director of Operations Support NCIS Mark N. Russ mentioned when talking about how he came up with a $500 million program for NCIS that took five years to develop. “Think about all those things that are really hard to do and come up with a bright idea to fix it.” 

Keep Going 

When asked about what she has learned from her biggest failure, DoD Associate Director of Diversity Management Operations Center Victoria L. Bowens said, “you cannot be successful if you do not make mistakes. When a job has become too easy, it is time to move, develop, and stretch yourself.” 

In response to the same question, NCIS Division Chief of Special Agent Career Services Angela R. Sanders said that her biggest mistake was letting people in her inner circle hold her back, even though they had good intentions. “There were people who were supportive of me early on in my career, but they were risk-adverse and would say things like ‘you’re probably not ready for that assignment. You should probably go somewhere else before you apply for that position,’ when I was actually ready for advancement.” She then explained how important it was to maintain professional networks outside one’s comfort zone because you are more likely to receive unbiased feedback, which is critical for growth and success.   

Do Not Be Afraid to Ask for Help 

There are people above you in the chain of command who are more than willing to help when asked. To this willingness, Russ pointed out the number of NNSY leaders present and said “They could have been anywhere today. Yet they came to this event―that says that they care about your future.”

Addressing the C.O.R.E. value of Care, the panel touched on how help is available in more than just the professional capacity. When Shipyard Commander Capt. Kai Torkelson asked about how to help federal civilian employees after experiencing trauma as a leader would in active service, Russ told him about the system of peer support that his organization developed and grew in response to similar situations. “It’s okay to ask for help,” Russ added. “You have options.” 

Closing remarks  

 At the end of the panel, each of the panel members were rewarded with a certificate of appreciation from the AA-ERG and a shipyard plaque for imparting their wisdom to the NNSY workforce, but they wanted to emphasize the main points one last time before they left.  

“Get yourself a mentor” SES of the Year and Director of Small Business Programs Jimmy D. Smith said towards the end of the discussion. “Keep growing and keep up the strong desire to do more. If there are roadblocks and you can’t clear them, find someone who can help.” Dutton chimed in and said, “Give it your one hundred percent. Show up, and do the work.”",2020/2/27,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/364776/norfolk-naval-shipyards-african-american-employee-resource-groups-2nd-annual-open-mic-did-make,"PORTSMOUTH, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州朴茨茅斯,诺福克海军造船厂的非裔美国人员工资源小组的第二届年度公开话筒――我是如何做到的？,作为2020年庆祝非裔美国人历史月的众多活动中的最后一项，诺福克海军造船厂（NNSY）的非裔美国人员工资源小组（AA-ERG）举行了第二届年度公开话筒会议。今年，该小组由国防部（DoD）、海军刑事调查局（NCIS）、文职人力资源办公室（OCHR）的五名高级领导以及海军海洋系统司令部（NAVSEA）的高级执行官组成。主题是“我是如何做到的？”小组成员回答了观众提出的问题，这些问题是关于他们从职业生涯中学到了什么。与会者提出了许多问题，但主要的收获是：带些东西到桌上，继续前进，不要害怕寻求帮助。向OCHR诺福克行动中心人力资源部门负责人提出一些建议，该部门负责为舰队司令部和海军预备役部队司令Danielle Dutton说，“最大的挑战之一是确保你定期评估自己的技能。当你寻找机会时，确保你看了自己的简历，它真实地传达了你所做和所做的一切，并确保你每天都为自己所做的事情感到自豪。”一个反复出现的话题是为问题提供解决方案的价值。SES NCIS运营支持副总监Mark N.Russ在谈到他如何为NCIS制定了一个花费5年时间的5亿美元的项目时提到，“想想所有那些确实很难做到的事情，想出一个好主意来解决它。”当被问及她从自己最大的失败中学到了什么时，国防部多元化管理运营中心副主任维多利亚・L・伯恩斯说：“如果你不犯错误，你就不可能成功。当一项工作变得太容易时，是时候让自己行动、发展和拓展了。”在回答同样的问题时，NCIS特别探员职业服务处处长安吉拉・R・桑德斯（Angela R.Sanders）说，她最大的错误是让她的核心圈子里的人阻止她，尽管他们有良好的意图。“在我职业生涯的早期，有人支持我，但他们对风险持负面态度，他们会说‘你可能还没有准备好接受那项任务。在申请那份工作之前，你可能应该去别的地方’，而我实际上已经准备好晋升了。”然后，她解释了在自己的舒适区之外维持专业关系网是多么重要，因为你更有可能获得公正的反馈，这对成长和成功至关重要。不要害怕寻求帮助在指挥链中，你之上的人在被要求时会非常愿意提供帮助Russ指出了NNSY领导人出席的人数，并说“他们今天可能去了任何地方。但他们来参加这次活动，说他们关心你的未来。”在谈到C.O.R.E.护理的价值时，该小组谈到了如何在不仅仅是专业能力的情况下提供帮助。当造船厂指挥官Kai Torkelson上尉询问如何帮助联邦文职雇员在经历了作为现役领导人的创伤后，Russ告诉他，他的组织tion在类似情况下发展壮大。“寻求帮助是可以的，”Russ补充道，“你有选择。”闭幕词在小组结束时，每个小组成员都获得了AA-ERG颁发的感谢证书和造船厂牌匾，以表彰他们向NNSY员工传授了自己的智慧，但他们想在离开前最后一次强调要点。“给自己找个导师”年度SES和小企业项目总监吉米・D・史密斯在讨论结束时说：“继续成长，保持做更多事情的强烈愿望。如果有路障，你无法清除，请找一个能帮助你的人。”达顿插嘴说，“全力以赴。来吧，做你的工作。”
55,African American-ERG Hosts Annual MLK Celebration,"The Norfolk Naval Shipyard (NNSY) African American Employment Resource Group (AA-ERG) hosted its annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Celebration Jan. 16 to honor the life and accomplishments of the late civil rights leader.

Martin Luther King Jr. Day, celebrated on the third Monday of January, coincides with King’s birthday. Known widely as a day of service, the theme observed each year is, “Remember. Celebrate. Act. A day on, not a day off.” The day provides those with an opportunity to not only remember the impact Dr. King had on the world, but also an opportunity to service their community.

“Dr. King was a man who put purpose above self,” said Shipyard Commander Capt. Kai Torkelson. “He gave his time and effort to make a change. And his legacy continues to live on to this day.” 

Torkelson continued, “We at America’s Shipyard follow in King’s footsteps to make lasting change. Every problem we face is an opportunity to make lasting change for the community, for the country, and for the world. We can serve others with our actions, our ambitions, and our drive. There is always work to be done and it takes that desire and that dream to make it a reality.” 

Rev. Dr. Jacqueline Hardy-Harris was the guest speaker for the event. She spoke of King’s dreams and efforts to bring equal rights to the forefront of America. 

“King was more than a civil rights leader. He was a prophet for change,” said Hardy-Harris. “He was not afraid to face what would test his faith. His efforts were catapulted in the national gaze. His non-violent campaigns were instrumental in the civil rights movement and ensuring equal rights in our country.” 

“King lived in constant danger for his dreams and actions. He was relentlessly harassed and jailed,” she added. “Yet he persevered. He would not back down from the fight. Because he believed that what he did was right.” 

Hardy-Harris then shared how King inspired her personally. “When I was nine years old, I had a dream of being a police officer,” she said. “There were no women on TV that were black and police officers and there were no black women on the police force. People would question my dream but I didn’t care. I wanted to be a police officer and help people. Just as King had a dream and fought to make it happen, so would I.” 

She continued, “In 1981, I was the first African American female officer assigned to the Kendall District in Miami. Within a year, I was promoted to detective and worked undercover in vice, narcotics, robbery and homicide. It was dangerous work and there were many days where I was scared for my life. But I enjoyed my career because I was making a difference. I was fulfilling a dream I had since I was a little girl. It was my destiny. King said I could do whatever I put my mind to. So I accomplished what I set out to do.” 

Torkelson said in closing, “At NNSY, our mission is any ship, any time, anywhere. Today’s message from Dr. Hardy-Harris is about turning dreams into reality and working to honor King’s legacy to guarantee equal rights and opportunities for all. In our command philosophy, we speak on the people being at the heart of our mission. We’re trying to build to our fullest potential as a high performing team that treats one another exceptionally well. By following that philosophy, we build on Care, Ownership, Respect, and Excellence C C.O.R.E. King once said, ‘life’s most persistent and urgent question C what are you doing for others?’ I encourage each of you to think on those words. We are entrusted with continuing the legacy of King and do our part to make positive change.” 

The NNSY AA-ERG’s goal is promoting economic opportunities, providing mechanisms for inclusion, and facilitating growth and advocacy by increasing knowledge and appreciation for the historical and cultural heritage of African Americans throughout NNSY and the surrounding communities. 

The NNSY AA-ERG meets the third Thursday of every month in Bldg. M-1 from 1:30 to 3 p.m. All shipyard employees, Sailors, and tenants are invited to attend.

56,NNSY ERG Spotlight- African American Employee Resource Group,"Norfolk Naval Shipyard’s (NNSY) African American C Employee Resource Group (AA-ERG) is one of seven ERGs hosted NNSY. Its goal is to be a place where an employee can go to get resources to help better both the shipyard and employee.

“The name of the ERG can be misleading,” said AA-ERG’s Chair, Michael Taylor. “The AA-ERG is open to all races, creeds, religions and so forth.”

The AA-ERG hosts the annual Martin Luther King, Jr. celebration every January as well as a variety of events during February for African American History Month. 

“This is a chance to remind everyone of the struggles and experiences that our ancestors went through,” said AA-ERG member, Ashley Chew. “Some people take for granted the freedom and opportunities that we have today.”

“We share the past so we can better ourselves in the future,” said Taylor. “We have to remember that we can’t change the past, but we can change the future.”

The AA-ERG helps to introduce people to opportunities. Members mentor and coach other shipyard employees so that they can reach their career and personal goals. They also promote internal job opportunities.

“We’re also a group where one can come to discuss matters and to vent,” said Taylor. “It’s a chance to learn from each other and to provide and receive perspectives on any given situation.”

If employees are having challenges with a variety of shipyard matters, they have a place to go to find out what is the best action to take.

“The AA-ERG helps employees by showing them not every issue needs to go to the Equal Opportunity Office,” said Taylor. “There are other ways that an issue could be resolved and we provide the resources to show them the way.”

The AA-ERG also partners with NNSY’s other resource groups.
“Throughout the year we join forces with the other shipyard ERGs,” said Taylor. “Working with other groups like the Federal Women’s Program, Native American Heritage C ERG and the others gives us a chance to show that we are all on one team. We all have the same kind of issues.”

57,The amphibious tip of the spear,"MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP PENDLETON, California C Amphibious warfare is the  cornerstone of how the Marine Corps trains and fights. For Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) crewmen or Amtrackers as they are often identified, the role is critical and contributes immensely to the Marine Corps warfighting capability. “AAV crewman are the tip of the spear when it comes to amphibious operations,” said U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Kevin Storman, instructor, Assault Amphibian School (AAS) Battalion, Training Command. 

At AAS the curriculum is focused on training Marines in the military occupational field of an AAV  crewmen, which entails learning the base knowledge of how to operate, fix and tactically employ an AAV. 

The AAV crewmen course is 55 training days long. In the first phase of the course, Marines are taught how to drive an AAV on land. The second phase teaches the basics for water driving and the third phase teaches employment of the vehicle’s two weapon systems; the  MK19 40 mm grenade launcher and the M2   .50 caliber machine gun. In the final portion of the course, students learn how the AAV compliments non-motorized infantry forces, and advanced amphibious assault tactics.

“We teach the students everything from starting the vehicle to all the components on the vehicle and what they are called,” said Storman. “We also teach them how to drive the AAV on land and on in the water. Finally, how to shoot the vehicle weapons and how to employ them tactically.” 

Amphibious assault school’s instructors are hand-picked for being the best in their community, and because they possess increased levels of experience. The greatest advantage of this selection process is that it ensures their knowledge and expertise is passed to new students, and that the probability of continued success on the battlefield improves. 

“Amtraking  isn’t just about what you learn in the classroom, it’s about what you can come up with on the fly,” said Storman. “As an amtraker you have to be able to think on your feet. Come up with the best solution for the situation that is going to help you to complete the overall mission.” 

AAVs transport Marines from ship to shore and can move inland up to 200 miles supporting the infantry along the way with fire power and supply.  

“The amtrak community is very prideful in what we do,” said Storman. “We are what makes the Marine Corps amphibious, and we believe that to the core of our soul. We take what we do very seriously and we are some of the hardest working Marines  you will find.”          

Storman said it is important to continue to pass AAV skills down to new Marines to keep the Marine Corps alive and fighting hard. Adding that the “ball needs to keep rolling,” and AAV crewman must keep applying their knowledge and skills now and with future amphibious vehicle technologies.

U.S. Marine Corps Pvt. Abel Vasquez, a student currently going through the AAV crewman course stated: “My goal for the future is to be like my instructors.   I want to be as good at being an AAV crewman as my instructors so in the future I can pass on that information to younger Marines. I hope I can build that foundation for future Marines.”",2019/1/31,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/309076/amphibious-tip-spear,"CAMP PENDLETON, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州彭德尔顿营地,矛的两栖尖端,加利福尼亚州彭德尔顿海军陆战队大本营――两栖作战是海军陆战队训练和作战的基石。对于经常被识别的突击两栖车辆（AAV）乘员或AMTRACKER而言，该角色至关重要，并对海军陆战队的作战能力做出了巨大贡献。训练司令部突击两栖动物学校（AAS）营讲师、美国海军陆战队中士凯文・斯托曼（Kevin Storman）说：“在两栖作战中，AAV乘员是最重要的。”。AAS的课程重点是在AAV乘员的军事职业领域培训海军陆战队，这需要学习如何操作、修理和战术使用AAV的基本知识。AAV乘员课程为期55天。在课程的第一阶段，海军陆战队将学习如何在陆地上驾驶AAV。第二阶段讲授水上驾驶的基础知识，第三阶段讲授车辆两种武器系统的使用；MK19 40毫米榴弹发射器和M2.50口径机枪。在本课程的最后一部分，学生们将学习AAV如何与非机动化步兵部队和先进的两栖攻击战术相结合。“我们教给学生从启动车辆到车辆上的所有部件以及它们被称为什么的一切。”斯托曼说。“我们还教他们如何在陆上和水中驾驶AAV。最后，如何射击车辆武器以及如何在战术上使用它们。”两栖突击学校的教员是经过精心挑选的社区中最好的，因为他们拥有更高水平的经验。这一选拔过程的最大优势在于，它确保了他们的知识和专业技能被传递给新生，并且提高了在战场上继续取得成功的概率。斯托曼说：“美国铁路公司不仅仅是你在课堂上学到了什么，而是你能在飞行中想出什么。”。“作为一名美国铁路公司，你必须能够独立思考。为这种情况想出最好的解决方案，帮助你完成整个任务。”AAV将海军陆战队从一艘船运送到岸上，并可以向内陆移动200英里，沿途为步兵提供火力和补给。斯托曼说：“美国铁路公司（amtrak）社区对我们所做的事情感到非常自豪。”。斯托曼说：“我们是海军陆战队水陆两栖作战的关键，我们坚信这一点。我们非常认真地对待我们所做的事情，我们是你会发现的最努力的海军陆战队中的一员。”继续将AAV技能传授给新的海军陆战队以保持海军陆战队的活力和战斗力是很重要的。他还补充道，“球需要继续滚动”，AAV乘员必须继续运用他们的知识和技能，无论是现在还是将来的两栖车辆技术。现役海军陆战队队员PVT阿贝尔巴斯克斯是一名AAV船员课程的学生，他说：“我未来的目标是像我的教练一样，我想成为一名AAV船员，就像我的教练一样，所以将来我可以把这些信息传递给年轻的海军陆战队。我希望我能为未来的海军陆战队建立基础。”
58,Improving leadership from the inside out,"MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP PENDLETON, California C “Don’t be afraid to try it,” proclaimed Staff Sgt. Molly Koman, platoon sergeant, 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion,1st Marine Division. “With the 21 Area Mentorship Workshop Program, all are welcome. It’s a great opportunity to learn from Marines of different ranks; learning how to be better leaders so we can mold others to exceed the expectations that we have for the future of the Marine Corps.” 

Capt. Tonie Williams, logistics officer, Assault Amphibian School Battalion (AAS Bn), Training Command, created the 21 Area Mentorship Workshop Program in June of this year. The workshop is held at the Del Mar Beach Resort bi-monthly and open to anyone who has base access. The program’s mission is to encourage leaders to strive to be their best self by bettering one another mentally, emotionally, physically and spiritually. Overall this workshop prepares leaders for some of the unique challenges they could potentially face in constantly changing environments. The course introduces participants to diverse training, perspectives and resources that show leaders how to improve their skills in working with co-workers and peers in their everyday lives and professional careers. 

“My intention is to work from the inside out because there are so many different types of leaders,” Williams said. “I really want to create that space for people to start or keep exercising that [mental] muscle as a leader.”

The 21 Area Mentorship Workshop Program works to unite Marines, Sailors and civilians from all walks of life, both personal and professional on MCB Camp Pendleton. They are encouraged to work and learn from one another to gain new perspectives in achieving goals. The program additionally focuses on different types of spiritualties to create stronger self-awareness. 

The workshop typically begins with a group activity called “the human knot,” which promotes teamwork and communication, and then immediately followed by team discussion. The participants then conduct yoga, also lead by Williams and Anna Packham, a yoga instructor with Marine Corps Community Services. After yoga, attendees are given an hour for lunch and a discussion about nutrition. The next activity called “the perfect circle,” is designed to strengthen leadership skills before concluding the workshop with one more group discussion. 

“The yoga was my favorite,” exclaimed Pfc. Cameron McCain, assault amphibian vehicle technician, AAS Bn, Training Command. “The yoga was unexpectedly hard. Some were better than others but I think that’s part of the lesson. Not everyone is equal, but we all still have to do our best.”

Williams said that working on spiritual fitness gives her a clear understanding of her goals. This in-turn, creates a better relationship with her Marines where she is able to understand and respect that everyone is unique. 

“You hear the saying that we have to be a well-rounded Marine all the time,” Koman said. “Most of the time, it’s misconstrued as we have to get a 300 on our [Combat Fitness Test], be an expert on the range, and get your [Professional Military Education] done. You also need to practice your core beliefs and values. It’s important to have those building blocks as an individual so that when you go into work and you have to lead others, you’ll be ready because you’ve already taken those steps.”

	Cole and fellow Paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division Sustainment Brigade and Fort Bragg battled with the chilly air as they negotiated their way through the Air Assault obstacle course on Fort Bragg, N.C., January 4, 2017.
	“The course was more challenging than I thought,” said Cole, a parachute rigger assigned to the 151st Division Aerial Delivery Company, 189th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion.  “It showed me what I need to work on before going to Air Assault.”
	More than 120 Paratroopers and Soldiers traversed the course with the intent of completing a prerequisite to attend an upcoming Air Assault class on Fort Bragg.
	The DeGlopper Air Assault School hosted this prerequisite training as a way for Fort Bragg units to certify Paratroopers and Soldiers on the course.
	“Attending our monthly obstacle course is not a requirement for entry into Air Assault,” said Sgt. 1st Class Joshua Bronson, Air Assault Chief Instructor.  “Soldiers must have their commanders state they are able to complete the course prior to enrollment.  We host the course monthly to allow units on [Global Response Force] or smaller units who cannot certify their Soldiers themselves due to circumstances.”
	The school graduates approximately 1,000 Soldiers and Paratroopers per year from the Air Assault course.  Air Assault instills confidence in service members to use rotary wing assets to accomplish the mission.
	The DeGlopper Air Assault School offers Air Assault, Rappel master and Fast Rope Insertion and Extraction System master courses since opening in 2014.

60,Single Marines keep each other strong,"MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. C Many Marines enlist looking for adventure, a chance to travel and experience things they never could have from home. Unfortunately for some Marines, those adventures just aren’t in the budget.

Since 1995, the Single Marine Program has been giving Marines and Sailors the opportunity to participate in trips and events, such as weekends in San Francisco or Las Vegas, at reduced prices. They also provide places to relax and unwind with fellow service members at facilities across the country.

“If you’re happy and stable then it’s going to allow you to work better,” said Travis Zeller, the manager of the Camp Del Mar SMP Recreation Center. 

Even with Department of Defense budget constraints, Marines can be confident that the SMP will continue offering an ever-growing range of activities and opportunities.

“The Single Marine Program is looked at as health and wellness because it supports mental strength,” said Zeller, a native of Temecula. “The commandant has always looked at the program as crucial for the wellness of Marines.”

Many young Marines who are away from their home, family and friends for the first time can feel a sense of loneliness. According to Cpl. Ashton Haymore, a food service specialist with Combat Service Support Company, I Marine Expeditionary Force Headquarters Group, some of the greatest tools to help Marines are Marines.

“I’ve run into quite a few Marines who are depressed,” said Haymore, a native of Woodbridge, Virginia, who is temporarily assigned to work at an SMP recreation center. “Some Marines only have someone to talk to because they come here and socialize. People who aren’t even in my office come up and talk to me about personal things because they know they can trust me.”

Haymore said she wishes she had gotten involved with the program earlier in her career. She explained that it is consistently a relaxing place for Marines to process the pressures and stress in their lives.

In addition to a number of recreational activities, including musical instruments, pool tables, top of the line video game systems, and hundreds of movies, the SMP provides places for Marines to make connections.
“We always respect each other, but to build that camaraderie between the ranks, getting together and enjoying time off is what’s really important,” said Haymore.
 
Information seems to be the biggest obstacle preventing Marines from participating in trips and events or visiting recreation centers, said Zeller. He explained that there seems to be a problem communicating what is available to the Marines who need it.

“There are guys who have lived in the barracks next to our building for years and don’t know what we do,” said Zeller. “We just want people to know that we’re here and we have lots of opportunities to have fun and relax.”

Zeller said the most rewarding part of working for the SMP is seeing the difference it makes for Marines and Sailors who are thousands of miles from home.

64,Love is a battlefield- Marines prepare to take on marriage,"MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. C The Marine Corps is often referred to as the nation’s 9-1-1 force because they are ready to take on any challenge at a moment’s notice. This readiness includes not only weapons and equipment proficiency, but also stability on the homefront.

Cmdr. James Johnson, the chaplain for I Marine Expeditionary Force Headquarters Group, presented pre-marital training at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Jan. 26, 2016.

The class was the second of three in the Intimate Relationship Awareness, Training, and Enrichment Program. The first section, “How to succeed at intimate relationships,” focused on being aware of intimate relationships and how they evolve over time. The second class, “Before saying I do,” prepares couples who have already decided to tie the knot for some of the challenges they might face and puts the idea of marriage into perspective.

“We want to get these young Marines to be fully aware of what an intimate relationship is and how to embrace and engage all levels of that relationship,” said Johnson, a Lake Park, Minnesota, native.

The presentation included the results of a survey conducted by Loma Linda University showing the need for the Marine Corps to take action to prepare their Marines. According to the study, young Marines are getting married and divorced at three times the rate of civilians the same age. 

“Marines were overestimating their readiness to get married and underestimating the challenges of being married,” said Johnson.

According to Johnson, the high divorce rates keep Marines emotional and distracted, which detracted from the readiness within their unit. The iRelate pre-marital training reduces the risk of divorce by ensuring that Marines understand themselves, their partner, and have the tools to overcome challenges they might face in their relationship.

A large portion of the class was dedicated to understanding some common obstacles to effective communication.

“I learned a lot about the ways men and women think differently,” said Sgt. Joselyn Alvarez, the assistant warehouse chief for Assault Amphibian School Supply, School of Infantry C West.

Alvarez, from Palmdale, said the class made her think about her emotions and communicating what she really feels instead of just her frustration.

“Anger can cover sadness and fear,” said Alvarez. “It makes a lot of sense when you think back to when you were mad, but maybe you were just covering another emotion with anger.”

Her fiancé, Brandon Keifer, from Assumption, Illinois, said that he’s caught himself doing just that on a few occasions.

“I’ve gotten upset with her before out of fear for her safety,” said Keifer. “I didn’t articulate myself well enough for her to understand why I was upset.”
Alvarez and Keifer met in Russia through the Marine Embassy Security Guard program. Their wedding is scheduled for July and they have been seeking out different forms of pre-marital preparation by reading and speaking with a chaplain.

They agreed that their research brought them a deeper understanding of what marriage is and a more solemn perspective of the commitment that they are making.

“Marriage is not something you should just do on a whim; you need to plan and think about what is going to happen,” said Alvarez. “You have to be mentally prepared, mature, and understand what you’re doing isn’t just moving in. Marriage is an allegiance.”

During the training, Johnson exposed the myth of “Hollywood love” where true love means never having any problems and feeling more in love every day. He also stressed the importance of patience, effort, and commitment through good times and bad.

“There is a tendency to think that a good marriage happens automatically and you either have one or you don’t,” said Johnson. “No Marine bases a deployment on hope; they base it on preparation, readiness, and full engagement of what it means to take on the challenges in front of them.”

Johnson stressed the proven benefits of pre-marital counseling, through iRelate or any other program, to reduce the risk of divorce and help Marines have more fulfilling marriages.

“It’s wonderful that the Marine Corps is keeping faith by offering programs like iRelate,” said Johnson. “If things are good on the homefront they go much better [while] deployed.”

65,Love is a battlefield- Marines train to combat divorce,"CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. - The Marine Corps is known for finding ways to overcome any challenge, but not every fight is on the battlefield.

Navy Lieutenant Cmdr. Aaron Kleinman, the chaplain for Assault Amphibian School Battalion, School of Infantry C West, presented a program succeeding at intimate relationships as part of the iRelate program, Jan. 12.

The iRelate program, which focuses on jumior enlisted, is made up of three different classes designed to help Marines make informed decisions whether they are already married, currently engaged, or are preparing for future relationships.

“iRelate was originally developed by Chaplain Michael Foskett as part of his thesis,” said Kleinman, a native of Norfolk, Virginia. “It is now a Loma Linda University PhD study being sponsored by I Marine Expeditionary Force.”

According to Kleinman, Marines can lose up to 90 work days while going through a divorce as well as emotional and physical health consequences. This stress can severely impact the combat readiness of a Marine, and in turn, the readiness of the unit.

The classes focused on intimate relationship awareness and used facts and statistics to disprove myths about marriage and long-term relationships.

“The most common misconception about marriage is that love is all you need,” said Kleinman. “People, especially junior Marines, go into marriage looking at it from a perspective of what they are going to get from it rather than what they are going to have to put in to make it work.”

Sergeant Danielle Auld, an ammunition technician with I MEF Logistics Office, said that the training did a good job of breaking down the information to show how relationships progress based on the effort and perspective of the people involved.

“They showed how all marriages aren’t going to be great all the time, you have to work for it,” said Auld from Cedar Rapids, Iowa. “You have to find yourself and be the person that the person you want to find is looking for.”

Countless books and classes are available to prepare couples for the ups and downs of long-term relationships, but iRelate gives unique insight into marriage for Marines.

“It’s the first marriage program that’s been developed from the ground up by Marines for Marines,” said Kleinman. “Most of the data that’s drawn for the iRelate presentation comes from a study of I MEF Marines.”

According to Kleinman, Loma Linda University is monitoring the program to provide accurate measurements of its long-term effectiveness, but that it really comes down to each individual who attends the classes.

“The real impact comes from whether a young Marine is willing to take on some of what they have learned and actually make a change,” said Kleinman. 

The other classes in the series are pre-marital training and marriage enrichment, which provide hands-on assistance to Marines and their spouses, not just for mental and emotional preparation, but filing official paperwork and command involvement.

66,Setting an example,"WHITECLOUD, Mich. -- More than one million and counting, is how many COVID-19 tests the state of Michigan has done in the last few months, after the first known cases were identified in the beginning of March.
Many of the tests have been performed by medics with the Michigan National Guard, who have gone into prisons and nursing homes to administer the tests to the most vulnerable. Now they are conducting it on Michiganders who want the peace of mind of knowing if they have it or not. 
“We are doing community-based testing for COVID-19 in partnership with District Health Department #10 and the Army National Guard, and serving the folks here in Newago County,” said George Davis, a clinical supervisor with District Health Department #10. “We know that this virus has a very scary fatality rate for people innocently living their lives, and we want to prevent the spread,” said Davis.
A spread that is ravaging the rest of the country, but has slowed down in Michigan. By testing as many as possible, the state health community would like to see it slowed down even more. District Health Department #10 did its part by helping conduct community testing and by having themselves tested as well. 
“We want to set an example that screening is an important part of health and community,” said Davis. “If we are recommending our community to do something, we are going to do it, too.”
Many had heard the test could hurt and were scared to do it, but were there encouraging each other to get it done, because as essential workers they know it is important for them to stay healthy. 
“We can provide information and encouragement after going through it ourselves,” said Kate Gilley, a community health worker for District Health Department #10. “It’s one more way we can advocate and support people. There is anxiety about doing the test and now having gone through it, it’s not nearly as bad as I had thought it to be.”
Gilley is out there most days helping those in her community get the resources they need to get through this pandemic. Whether this is helping to link them up to the resources or dropping food off in a safe way to their house, she feels fortunate to be helping. 
 “I felt my job was even more important, and I’ve seen communities coming together to help people and that’s been amazing,” said Gilley.
Helping the community is what the Michigan National Guard medics are doing. They have been performing thousands of tests on civilians, to help everyone reclaim their lives.  
“I think everybody’s on the same page and has the same common goal in mind,” said Spc. Derek Conaway. “I don’t think I would have ever pictured myself in a full set of personal protective equipment testing people for a virus, but we do what we have to do.”
Conaway, who is with Assembly Area Lugnuts, joined the National Guard to help his community and state, and has had the best experiences of his life all while helping others.
 “There’s nothing better I don’t think, especially in times like now, when we get to be there and help each other out,” said Conaway. “Being there for your community and everyone at home, it’s a really good feeling.”
By having the test done on themselves by National Guard medics, the community health workers are proving that part of helping is partnering. (Story by Michigan Army National Guard Staff Sgt.

The air show consisted of static displays, aircraft from different military branches and food vendors for those in attendance to enjoy during the show. Marines with various units brought static displays of their own for the show, including: 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marine Regiment; 1st Battalion, 10th Marine Regiment; 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion; 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion and 2nd Intelligence Battalion.

Some of the Marines participated in a demonstration for the attendees of the air show to exhibit the capabilities of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force.

“The MAGTF demo was a [Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel] scenario,” said Maj. Jeremy Siegel, the Personnel Support Detachment company commander for Marine Aircraft Group 31. “We were assigned to demonstrate a downed pilot, and then the Marine TRAP team was put in place to rescue that downed pilot.” 

Many of the same aircraft used in the MAGTF demonstration were on display to the public along the flight-line.

“We are showcasing the CH-53E Super Stallion to the public so they can see what Marine heavy lift is all about,” said Capt. David Harris, the operations and scheduling officer with Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 464, Marine Aircraft Group 29. “It’s an integral piece of the MAGTF, and heavy lift is essential to the Marines on the ground and that’s what we are here for - to support the infantry. We carry food, troops, cargo, mail, parts, bullets - you name it.”

The Marines who participated in the MAGTF demonstration were proud of their performance and enjoyed showing those who attended the air show the capabilities of their aircraft and their pilots’ abilities.

“There are civilian air shows that don’t have this kind of exposure of military aircraft and military [operations],” Harris said. “These air shows are the only opportunity that the public has to see what their tax money is doing for them and how essential the Marine Corps and the armed services are to national security.”",2015/4/12,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/160103/flying-high-ii-mef-marines-participate-air-show,"MARINE CORPS AIR STATION BEAUFORT, SC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国南卡罗来纳州波弗特海军陆战队航空站,飞高-II MEF海军陆战队参加航展,南卡罗来纳州波弗特海军陆战队航空站――海军陆战队与第二海军陆战队远征军各部队参加了由南卡罗来纳州波弗特海军陆战队航空站主办的航展，以展示海军陆战队在航空站上的能力。航展包括静态显示，来自不同军种和食品供应商的飞机，供观众在展会期间享用。海军陆战队和不同的部队带来了他们自己的静态显示器，包括：第二营，第二海军陆战队团；海军陆战队第十团第一营；第二突击两栖营；第二轻装甲侦察营和第二情报营。一些海军陆战队成员参加了一次展示海军陆战队空地特遣部队能力的演示。杰里米・西格尔少校说：“MAGTF演示是一个[飞机和人员的战术恢复]场景。”，海军陆战队31组人员保障支队连指挥官。“我们被派去演示一名被击落的飞行员，然后海上捕鲸队被派去营救那名被击落的飞行员。”MAGTF演示中使用的许多飞机在飞行线上向公众展示。“我们正在向公众展示CH-53E超级种马，这样他们就可以了解海上重型起重是什么，”海军陆战队29飞机组464海军陆战队重型直升机中队的作战和调度官戴维・哈里斯上尉说。“它是MAGTF不可分割的一部分，重型起重对地面上的海军陆战队至关重要，这就是我们在这里的目的――支持步兵。我们运送食物、军队、货物、邮件、零件、子弹――你可以说得通。”参加MAGTF演示的海军陆战队为他们的表现感到自豪，并乐于向参加航展的人展示他们飞机的性能和飞行员的能力。“有一些民用航展没有这种军用飞机和军事行动的曝光，”哈里斯说。“这些航展是公众唯一的机会，让他们了解他们的税收为他们做了什么，以及海军陆战队和武装部队对国家安全的重要性。”
68,Fort Campbell medics test their expertise,"FORT CAMPBELL, Ky -- Service members of the 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), tested their knowledge, patience, strength and endurance as they sought to earn the Expert Field Medical Badge, from June 5 through June 22.
The EFMB is a special skill badge that was established in 1965. It is earned through an annual qualification event and is awarded to military personnel who successfully complete a set of tests including performance based exercises that test medical knowledge and proficiency. 
“It’s not an easy badge to get statistically,” said Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Vecchione, medical platoon sergeant, 2nd Battalion, 506th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault). “That’s why people want to come out here and get the badge because it’s a mark of excellence.”
Soldiers participated in various challenging events such as a comprehensive written exam, three Combat Testing Lanes, day and night land navigation, and a 12-mile road march. Soldiers had to complete these tasks with little to no error to receive a passing grade on each event.
The EFMB testing is a completely voluntary event and is not a requirement for the medical field. In 2013 the attrition rate for obtaining the EFMB was 19%, making it one of the most prestigious and difficult special skill badges to be earned.
“We usually expect 10 to 20% to pass,” said 1st Lt. Taylor Allen, the officer in charge of CTL1 at the EFMB testing course.
The candidates received training at their home unit, then arrive at the EFMB testing course. The testing phase is five days but the candidates spent two weeks at the course getting familiar with the CTL’s, conducted study halls, and observed the cadre go through the lanes to see how to properly maneuver the course.
According to Vecchione, you definitely have to want it. There’s people out here who have tried multiple times to get their EFMB. 
This training event challenges soldiers in medical tasks, Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and Nuclear tasks and evacuation tasks, said Allen. It gives home units an idea if their medics are equipped for anything that the enemy can throw at them.
“To me it shows that I am proficient at memorizing things and putting my mind to the test,” said Spc. Tyler Miller, medic, 1st Battalion, 32nd Cavalry Regiment, 1st Brigade Combat Team. “I was very excited when I found out that I was going to be able to come.”
Out of 107 candidates that started the EFMB testing, only 18 were honored to receive the coveted EFMB. Not only does this show how difficult it can be to obtain the EFMB, but it gives other soldiers an idea of what to expect as they train and prepare to take on the grueling challenge of the EFMB test course.

70,A Falcon swoops through Fort Campbell,"FORT CAMPBELL, Kentucky C Andre Roberts, wide receiver for the Atlanta Falcons, came to teach Fort Campbell children, not only football skills, but the importance of hard work, during his Procter and Gamble Andre Roberts Football ProCamp, here July 15-16. 
This is the second time Fort Campbell has hosted the ProCamp, an opportunity made possible by the base commissary’s participation in a P&G display contest, from which it was selected among 11 communities to hold the two-day event.
According to a Defense Commissary Agency press release, “Our communities, especially the children, benefit from our partnership with industry that brings these football stars to their installations,” said Sallie Cauthers, DeCA’s marketing and mass media specialist. “At the same time, our commissary patrons save significantly on quality products versus what they’d have to pay outside the gate.”
More than 100 children, dependents of active duty service members, retirees, and Department of Defense civilian employees, participated in the ProCamp. The campers were divided into three divisions for different ages; the Vikings, Bulldogs and the Falcons. Campers received hands-on instructions, motivational talks, and participated in skill stations such as offense and defense drills, quarterback drills, and how to run lanes. At the culmination of each day the campers played non-contact football games to determine a division champion by the end of camp.
“Just work hard no matter what, if you get tired it doesn’t matter,” said Roberts. “Just make sure you’re working hard and having fun.”
The campers had the opportunity to have Roberts help them with various drills and received autographed memorabilia. They were also able to ask Roberts questions about his football journey. Most of the campers wanted to know how Roberts became so good in high school.
 “First and foremost you have to get good grades,” said Roberts. “Make sure when you go to school, you listen to your teachers and get those good grades. It doesn’t matter if you want to play football or not,” said Roberts. “If you want to do anything in life, you have to work hard and that begins in school getting good grades.”
Bill Conley, the Master of Ceremonies for the ProCamp, gave praise to the answers given by Roberts, reaffirming the importance of hard work and effort.
“As a player, you have to be a guy that is an inspiration to those under you,” said Conley, “Learn from others and carry on that tradition.” 	
When speaking to the campers, Roberts mentioned the fact that when he was younger he did not play football due to his mother being worried about him getting hurt. He used this opportunity to express the advantage of playing other sports.
“When I was kid I played baseball, soccer, and I played basketball, and basketball was my passion,” said Roberts. “That’s a good thing for you guys to do, too; don’t just focus on one sport. Soccer can help you with footwork, baseball will help you with hand and eye coordination, and things like that will help you with football.”
At the culmination of the camp, Roberts gave the campers some words of encouragement, and a backstory of what it was like growing up in a military family.
Roberts shared with the campers that he too was born into a military family and both his parents served in the Army. He told them he moved around a lot, living in Alaska, Texas, Columbia; twice; and St. Croix.
 “I know everything you guys may be going through right now and may have to go through as kids, “said Roberts. “I’m here to let you know that anything you want to do is possible, doesn’t matter where you come from or what walk of life you come from, anything you want to do is possible, but the only way you get there is putting in the effort.”
“I saw a lot of effort out there, a lot of hustle, a lot of kids having fun and that’s what you have to do each and every day when it comes to football and when it comes to school, said Roberts. “Everybody out here, learn from today, no matter what you want to be, you have to put in the effort.”

71,Commentary- Dear Alcohol ...,"ROBINS AIR FORCE BASE, GA. -- Dear Alcohol, I’m sure you’ve been wondering where I’ve been the last few years. And although I know you feel you deserve an explanation, it’s really none of your business. Even so, here you go.

There’s no denying that you’ve always been there for me. In fact, you’ve been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. Regardless whether it was a birthday, wedding, cookout, or a family vacation there you were just chilling in the corner or mixing it up with the sodas and fruit juice. 

Yep, you were the fun one in the crowd. It seems like someone was always talking about whether or not you were invited, if you needed a ride to the party or if you were going to be available for the work functions we were to attend. Some of my friends got along with you well, but you and me? We were tight. 

From the first time we hung out together, I felt like you made everything easier. It didn’t matter if it was meeting new people, interacting with old friends or winding down from a stressful day at work. I could always count on you to make things more relaxed … more manageable … more exciting.

And, you were there for the tough times too. You were right beside me when deaths, illnesses and conflicts crippled me with anxiety or broke me down spiritually and emotionally. You knew just the right way to numb the pain. 

Yeah, we were the best of friends.

I could handle anything if you were along for the ride ... Unfortunately those rides ended up landing me in jail on more than one occasion. Still, I told myself it had nothing to do with you. When our other friends began to hang out with you less, I just found new friends who liked you better. And, over the years, that became a pattern. 

What I didn’t notice was that it wasn’t just you our friends were avoiding, it was me. The baggage started piling up. I tried ever so valiantly, but I couldn’t seem to gain control of the seemingly countless suitcases filled with issues on the revolving track at baggage claim after each flight.

Those flights became more frequent. 

With every trip we took together, I spent less time with my wife and children. I isolated myself from my parents and brother … my dearest friends. Hey, but with all the frequent flier miles I was accumulating, it seemed a travesty not to cash them in for another trip.

Even as things became darker, I sought refuge and ill-placed solace in your company. I tried skipping out on a few occasions without you, but it always ended up with you there C enticing me with promises of an end to my uncertainty and my damaged self-esteem.

There were weekends when I would wake up shaking, nauseous and ill … until you showed up for breakfast. And, I was thankful to see you. But then breakfast led to lunch followed by dinner. You were a houseguest who overstayed your welcome, and I was losing more of myself with each visit.

That’s when I started blaming you. When I took inventory of the bad things in my life, there was always one constant C you. Not only that, but fun was no longer part of the equation. The only thing you were offering me was a soulless black hole where I began depositing my hopes, my dreams and my desires.

When you started stealing time from me I knew our trip had just about run its course. It was only upon great reflection that I realized you were only stealing time from my memories … not from those of the people who love and care about me who were hopelessly watching me circling the drain through a funnel into the bottom of a bottle.

So here we are. When I’m with you everything that means anything to me is at risk C my life, my marriage, my children, my friendships and my livelihood. 

That said, I can’t lay the blame solely on your shoulders. I chose to take part in your plots and schemes. It was I who turned my back on those offering help, and I who continued to hang around with you even when I knew our relationship was only leading to hopelessness and despair. 

So I’ll own up to my end of it. And, my end of it means that we can’t be friends anymore. There is nothing you can offer me to solve my problems … nothing you can provide that I can’t get with the help of God, my family or on my own … and nothing you can do will change my mind.

Yeah, we’ll still see each other around … on TV, in magazines, at restaurants and in corner markets. And, I know that I’ll see you hanging out with my friends. But don’t mistake my tolerance for acceptance. Our adventure has come to an end, and I’ve been on a new quest with the truest friend I’ve ever known … my sobriety.

From the author: Do you or someone you care about have a drinking problem? Help is available. I know it’s hard, but  if you just reach out and ask for help, you’ll get it. I know it can be a scary and embarrassing thing to face, but if you want it badly enough, you can do it.  In my experience, the payoff is so well worth it. It’s been more than three years since I quit drinking, and everything in my life has improved dramatically.  For me, not one single thing  was made worse.

72,Marines attack the North Carolina beach in armored vehicles,"CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. - “My AMTRAC and I are the defenders of our country. We are the masters of gunnery. We are the saviors from the ocean.”  Marines from 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 2nd Marine Division know these lines well because it comes from their AMTRAC creed.

An AMTRAC (Amphibious Tractor) is an amphibious assault vehicle used to provide the necessary transportation of troops from land to sea, and vice versa. Not only do AAV operators bring Marines where they need to go, but they can also fight alongside their brothers-in-arms.

“My job is very important; I know that for a fact,” said Lance Cpl. Jorge De Jesus, an AAV operator with 3rd Platoon, Alpha Company, 2nd AA Bn., and a Bronx, New York native. “I transport troops, I’m able to shoot, move and communicate, and I take the fight closer than what other people can.”

As a department of the Navy, the Marine Corps and its sister-service work closely together, especially when it comes to amphibious operations.

Members of 2nd AA Bn. embarked on the multipurpose amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD-3), April 12, 2015.  Sailors aboard the ship guided the AAV operators through the well-deck of the ship as part of a Joint Operations Access Exercise. The ship hosted the 2nd AA Bn. Marines for one night, until they transported Marines from 1st Battalion, 6th Marine Regiment to a training area aboard Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

“We’re both helping each other out,” said De Jesus of the sailors. “They need qualification for their ground guides, and we need the qualification to get on ship and know what we need to do during [Marine Expeditionary Brigade] floats and [Marine Expeditionary Units]. The relationship between the 
two services is crucial.”

After securing their vehicles in the well deck of the USS Kearsarge, the Marines performed proactive maintenance on their vehicles by changing oil and fixing small problems while on ship. Operators and mechanics of AAVs know that taking care of the vehicles is a huge part of achieving mission accomplishment, especially since one hour of 
operating an AAV requires eight hours of maintenance. 

Despite the long hours it may take to maintain an amphibious vehicle, many Marines feel a sense of pride in the important role they play for the Marine Corps.

“It’s a rewarding feeling knowing that you actually make a difference in the fight,” said De Jesus.  “Sometimes [our job requires] long hours, but at the end of the day… when you plan something and it comes together, the hours don’t really matter anymore. I love what I do.”",2015/4/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/160519/marines-attack-north-carolina-beach-armored-vehicles,"CAMP LEJEUNE, NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国北卡罗来纳州勒琼营,海军陆战队用装甲车袭击北卡罗来纳海滩,北卡罗来纳州勒琼营―“我和我的AMTRAC是我们国家的捍卫者。我们是射击大师。我们是海洋的救世主。”海军陆战队第二师第二突击两栖营的海军陆战队非常熟悉这些路线，因为它来自他们的AMTRAC信条。AMTRAC（两栖拖拉机）是一种两栖突击车，用于将部队从陆地运送到海上，反之亦然。AAV操作员不仅可以将海军陆战队带到他们需要去的地方，还可以与他们的战友并肩作战。“我的工作非常重要；我知道这是事实，”兰斯下士Jorge De Jesus说，他是AAV第二连阿尔法连第三排的AAV操作员，也是纽约本地人。作为海军的一个部门，海军陆战队和它的姐妹部队紧密合作，特别是在两栖作战方面。第二海军陆战队成员。2015年4月12日，登上多用途两栖攻击舰Kearsarge号（LHD-3）。作为联合行动进入演习的一部分，船上的水手引导AAV操作员穿过船上的钻井甲板。该船主办了第二次美航。海军陆战队一个晚上，直到他们从海军陆战队第六团第一营运送海军陆战队到北卡罗莱纳州海军陆战队大本营Lejeune上的一个训练区。“我们都在互相帮助，”海军陆战队的De Jesus说。“他们需要获得地面向导的资格，我们需要获得上船的资格，知道我们在[海军陆战队远征旅]浮标和[海军陆战队远征部队]期间需要做什么。这两个军种之间的关系至关重要。”在将他们的车辆固定在Kearsarge号航母的钻井甲板上后，海军陆战队通过在船上换油和解决小问题对车辆进行了主动维护。AAV的操作员和机械师都知道，维护车辆是完成任务的重要组成部分，特别是因为一个小时的AAV操作需要八个小时的维护。尽管维修两栖车辆可能需要很长的时间，但许多海军陆战队对他们在海军陆战队中扮演的重要角色感到自豪。“知道你在战斗中确实发挥了作用，这是一种值得的感觉，”德・耶酥说。“有时候[我们的工作]需要很长的时间，但在一天结束的时候……当你计划某件事并把它结合在一起时，时间真的不再重要了。我喜欢我所做的。”
73,"Air Force reservists, active duty train to survive","FORT WORTH, Texas - More than 70 reservists and active duty service members from three different units participated in water survival training at Naval Air Station Key West, Florida, Sept. 14 - 18, 2015.

Service members from the 301st Fighter Wing here and its geographically separated F-22 unit, the 44th Fighter Group at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, teamed up with the 920th Rescue Wing, Patrick AFB, Florida, and Naval Air Station Key West Base Operations, Key West, Florida, to provide this training.

""This training is a combat training requirement that keeps pilots deployment-ready,"" said Master Sgt. John Gibson, 301st Operations Support Flight Aircrew Flight Equipment.

During the five-day water training spearheaded by AFE, pilots learned how to escape parachute entanglements, use a signal mirror to reflect sunlight up to 50 miles away and survive on a one-man life raft. 

""Out there, they learned longevity, ways to increase their chances of survivability and how to use their equipment properly in a real-world training scenario,"" Gibson said. ""This also helps our AFE members to sharpen their skills by getting real hands-on training.""

While the pilots learned how to disengage their parachutes so they aren't drug under water, the PJs honed their particular skills as well.

""We're going to hoist them up out of the water and deal with the dangers and procedures that come with that,"" said Master Sgt. Blain Morgan, 308th Rescue Squadron pararescueman jumper attached to the 920 RQW. ""There will also be a medical exercise where we extract an Airman, evaluate him and treat him as necessary. It's a good experience for everybody."" 

This type of combat training is required every three years and there is also a 180-day equipment training requirement. For some, this was a necessary refresher. For others, this was a first-time experience.

""It's an opportunity which our young guys have never seen and they get academics on it, but until you're actually in the water with the helicopter beating down on you ... it's an eye-opening experience,"" 301st Fighter Wing Vice Commander Col. Robert Buchanan said. ""It's great training for everyone and a great chance to come together both as a wing and as the Reserve.""

This exercise provided the unique opportunity for all participants to demonstrate the individual training they have learned and apply it in a total force integration hands-on training effort.

""There's a definite synergy in joint training because you bring together so many different experiences and training expertise,"" Col. Brian Neal, 44th Fighter Group commander, said. ""The training we're going to garner this week is going to be unmatched. It's going to be exactly like (what) they might encounter, should something misfortunate happen.""

The goal is to continue with this total force training setting and keep it as realistic as possible.

""There are some things you can simulate and some things you can't,"" Buchanan said. ""If we are going to train like we are going to fight, here's the one chance where we can actually go out, perform the training, get picked up and rescued. So if it comes down to it, in wartime, we're ready to go.""",2015/9/28,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/178654/air-force-reservists-active-duty-train-survive,"FORT WORTH, TX, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国德克萨斯州沃思堡,空军预备役人员，现役训练以生存,德克萨斯州沃思堡―2015年9月14日至18日，来自三个不同部队的70多名预备役军人和现役军人参加了佛罗里达州基韦斯特海军航空站的水上生存训练。来自这里的3011战斗机联队及其地理位置不同的F-22部队，廷德尔空军基地的第44战斗机群的现役军人，与佛罗里达州第920救援联队、佛罗里达州帕特里克空军基地和佛罗里达州基韦斯特海军航空站基韦斯特基地作战部合作，提供这项训练。“这项训练是一项战斗训练要求，可使飞行员随时做好部署准备，”约翰・吉布森上士说，301行动支持飞行机组的飞行设备。在AFE牵头的为期五天的水上训练中，飞行员学会了如何摆脱降落伞缠绕，使用信号镜反射50英里以外的阳光，并在单人救生筏上生存。吉布森说：“在那里，他们学会了长寿、提高生存能力的方法以及如何在真实训练场景中正确使用设备。”。“这也有助于我们的AFE成员通过实际动手训练来提高他们的技能。”虽然飞行员学会了如何解开降落伞，这样他们就不会在水下吸毒，但PJ也磨练了他们的特殊技能。“我们将把他们吊离水面，并处理随之而来的危险和程序。”隶属920 RQW的第308营救中队助理营救员跳伞员布莱恩・摩根上士说。“我们还将进行一次医疗演习，对一名飞行员进行解救、评估和必要的治疗。这对每个人来说都是一次很好的经历。”这种战斗训练每三年进行一次，还需要180天的装备训练。对一些人来说，这是必要的复习。对于其他人来说，这是第一次体验。“这是我们的年轻人从未见过的机会，他们对此进行了学术研究，但除非你真的在水中被直升机击倒……这是一次令人大开眼界的体验，”第301战斗机联队副指挥官罗伯特・布坎南上校说。“这对每个人来说都是一次很好的训练，也是一次很好的机会，可以作为一个联队和预备队走到一起。”这一练习为所有参与者提供了一次独特的机会，展示他们所学到的个人训练，并将其应用到整个部队整合的实践训练中。第44战斗群指挥官布赖恩・尼尔上校说：“联合训练有着明确的协同作用，因为你汇集了这么多不同的经验和训练专业知识，我们本周要进行的训练将是无与伦比的。布坎南说：“我们的目标是继续进行这种全力以赴的训练，并尽可能保持现实。有些事情你可以模拟，有些事情你不能模拟。如果我们要像战斗一样训练，这是一个机会，在这里我们可以真正走出去，进行训练，被接走并获救。因此，如果归结起来，在战时，我们准备好了。”
74,All Americans never stop being Paratroopers,"“I jumped out of my first airplane in April of 1995,” said Master Sgt. Travis Cooke, the 1st Battalion, 73rd Cavalry Regiment battalion sergeant major of operations. “Back then we graduated on Fryar Drop Zone.
“My wife and one-year-old son came down to watch my last jump, and the wing pinning ceremony,” he added.
Little did Cooke know that 22 years later, the same son that watched him graduate Airborne School, would be jumping out of an airplane with his father. The jump that carried both father and son would be a millstone for the pair. For Travis, it would be his first jump with his son. For Cpl. Michael Cooke, an Alpha Company, 2nd Battalion, 325 Airborne Infantry Regiment team leader, it would be his fifth jump and qualify him as a paratrooper.
	While visiting the Airborne School, Travis was able to jump not once, but twice with his son.
	“I was able to jump twice with my son,” said Travis. “Mirroring our family experience, his two-year-old daughter was running around Fryar Drop Zone, and watched her daddy jump for the fifth time.”
	For Michael, the contrast in attitudes between his classmates and father when preparing to exit the aircraft spoke volumes.
	“Anybody that’s been to Airborne School knows that there’s terrified faces all on that plane,” said Michael. “Everybody is fricking scared; it’s their first time jumping out, their first couple of times.
“You look past all those terrified faces, you just see my dad happy as hell, just smiling ear to ear, loves what he does and that was a pretty big turning point for me; (that’s) when I realized that jumping out of an airplane can be fun. It doesn’t have to be just scary,” Michael added.
	Travis was able to share another pivotal moment for paratroopers when he was able to pin the coveted silver wings up Michael’s chest.
	“But it gets even better; Airborne School allows 2nd and 3d generation Paratroopers to be pinned by their predecessors, so I got to go up and put his airborne wings on his chest,” said Travis.
	After their shared experience at Airborne School, Travis went back to Fort Bragg, N.C. with the intent to have his son become a paratrooper within the 82nd Airborne Division. With the help of his chain of command, Travis was able to secure a spot for Michael within the division.
	“A few short months later he signed into division,” said Travis.
	Michael spoke of the culture shock that comes with the dawning of the red beret and wearing the double A patch.
“When you come here to the 82nd the loyalty to the division runs deep,” said Michael. “It means something different to everybody, but every single person is proud of their unit. They’re proud of the division.”
Travis shared the passion his Michael relayed to him after his first day in division.
“I asked Mike, after his first day at work, what he thought of Alpha Company, 2/325 Airborne Infantry Regiment,” said Travis.  “He said it felt like “coming home,” that the people spoke in ways that we do around the house, they act as we act, they are always walking around singing about putting on their boots, boots, boots, and parachutes, chutes, chutes.”
Travis felt the same emotions when he first stepped into the coveted jump boots.
“When I first saw the reflection of myself wearing class As, beret and boots as a corporal it changed the goals I had in my life,” said Travis. “I never wanted to do anything other than to be a paratrooper, to be surrounded by paratroopers and to lead paratroopers.
“It turns out the same is true of my son,” Travis added.
Those shared experiences continued to accumulate as Travis had the opportunity to perform his 100th airborne jump when Michael made his first jump in division. 
“This time was different,” said Travis. “At Benning, I jumped ahead of him, and my brain saw it as me training him by doing it first. This time he insisted on exiting ahead of me.”
Travis said that as they sat on the aircraft, his mind kept drifting back to the fact that he was sitting next to his child, a kid whose diapers he had changed, and that he was about to throw himself out of the aircraft they were riding in.
“It’s hard to emphasize enough how weird that is,” said Travis. “But every one of us is someone’s kid, and every paratrooper’s parents worry about them, I just happened to be exiting with my kid.
“And for real, if the job weren’t a little dangerous, it wouldn’t be cool,” Travis added.
 Though he cares for his son’s safety, Travis has confidence in the training of the division paratroopers and once the doors opened all of those thoughts disappeared.
“He kept his elbow high, didn’t ride the pack tray ahead of him and exited without hesitation,” said Travis. “That’s some proud dad stuff right there, my boy is a paratrooper!”
	After a safe jump, Michael was able to official proclaim himself as a paratrooper within the 82nd Abn. Div. and Travis was able to achieve the highly prized 100th jump. A moment that was commemorated officially on the parade field.
	“A friend of mine and previous co-worker Sgt. 1st Class Matt Thompson was a member of the Silver Wings Parachute club,” said Travis. “On the demonstration jump for the pinning ceremony, (he) jumped in with Mike’s wings and my static line from my 100th exit and gave them both to us on the parade field.”
	After his first jump in division, Michael saw the difference between jumping at the school and division.
	“I found that jumps at division, there’s more confidence involved,” said Michael. “You’re more confident in your own abilities; you’re more confident in your jumpmasters. These are jumpmasters that you know, you see every day and you know they’re proficient.
“As proficient as the jumpmasters at Fort Benning might be you don’t see them every single day at work,” Michael added.
For Travis, the division is more than just a unit within the armed forces of the United States.
	“Sons following in their father’s footsteps is a different thing between other divisions and the 82nd,” said Travis. “From my perspective, America’s Guard of Honor has its own persona, it is a living thing that reaches beyond the end of paratroopers’ careers and lives. It becomes a way that our families think and live with. All Americans never stop being Paratroopers.”

The Marines with 2nd Assault Amphibian Battalion, and 2nd Tank Battalion, 2nd Marine Division provided support for the Marines of 2nd CEB, which allowed the engineers to work in conjunction with units that they would support in a real combat situation.
The MCCRE consisted of multiple scenarios, including route clearance exercises in between operations, survivability training, an urban breaching exercise, and their culminating event which consisted of a company breach with the support of 2nd Tank Bn. and 2nd AA Bn.
Throughout the scenarios, the Marines’ performance was evaluated. [The evaluation] allows the Marine Corps to give us feedback, whether positive or not, so that we may improve for the better of the unit and the mission, said Capt. Curtis Register, the unit’s operations officer in charge.

76,"African alumni, US Army highlight leadership, global security at symposium","VICENZA, Italy C Thirty-seven senior officers from 19 African partner nation militaries recently returned to the United States to attend the 2020 African Alumni Symposium at the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, March 9-12.

Participants in the U.S. Army Africa-conducted and U.S. Army War College-hosted event included African alumni of U.S. Army professional military education programs at the USAWC in Carlisle and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College in Leavenworth, Kansas. Twenty African fellows currently enrolled at the USAWC and nine Army National Guard representatives from the Defense Department’s State Partnership Program were also in attendance.

This year’s event was the largest AAS to date, with approximately 66 participants representing 27 African nations and nine of the continent’s 13 SPP partnerships.

The symposium, a U.S. Africa Command initiative, brings participants together to strengthen existing partnerships as well as build new relationships among African senior military leaders and the U.S. Army and facilitate discussion about shared security concerns, as well as encourage regional cooperation in addressing challenges.

The event also offers participants an opportunity to reexamine current models of leadership decision making, and to discuss ways to improve those processes not just for current leaders, but also for decision makers of the future, said Maj. Gen. John S. Kem, the USAWC commandant.

“How can we do this in a better way? Because that’s the challenge that we all face,” he said. “We all have hard problems; we all have questions. We’ve all got ways we can do things differently or better. How do you generate an idea and get it to impact? That’s really what we are here to talk about.”

During his opening ceremony remarks, Col. Ed Williams, the USARAF security cooperation directorate director, expressed that this event is a priority for the command because global security depends upon security on the African continent, which requires long-term partnerships of trust and common purpose between military leaders.

“Global security is impossible without a secure, stable and prosperous Africa, and we’ll achieve that by working together through a network of partnerships,” he said. “No one nation can do this alone.”

The event’s overarching theme was “Security Tomorrow Demands Leadership Today.” Participants met in plenary sessions and breakout groups to discuss defense leadership-related topics, including 21st century challenges for military leaders, developing leaders through defense institutions, and defense leadership in a multinational environment. The event also included a staff ride to American Civil War battle site Antietam National Battlefield in Sharpsburg, Maryland.

Williams encouraged the participants to be candid in their discussions to promote understanding and continued regional cooperation and coordination and secure a stable and prosperous Africa.

“The world is complex and dynamic and African militaries face some of the most diverse security challenges in the world: insurgencies, armed conflicts, illicit trafficking, piracy, organized crime and violent extremist organizations,” he said. “As you know, these threats have no boundaries C crossing borders, destabilizing regions, and often requiring coordinated multinational responses. The military is of course not the solution in Africa, but is certainly part of the solution.”",2020/3/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/366142/african-alumni-us-army-highlight-leadership-global-security-symposium,UNITED STATES,[],[],美国,非洲校友、美国陆军在研讨会上强调领导力、全球安全,意大利维琴察―来自19个非洲伙伴国家军队的37名高级军官最近返回美国，参加在宾夕法尼亚州卡莱尔美国陆军遗产和教育中心举行的2020年非洲校友研讨会，3月9日至12日。参加美国陆军非洲部举办和美国陆军战争学院主办的活动的有卡莱尔USAWC和堪萨斯州利文沃斯美国陆军指挥与参谋学院美国陆军专业军事教育课程的非洲校友。目前有20名非洲研究员参加了USAWC，来自国防部州合作项目的9名陆军国民警卫队代表也参加了。今年的活动是迄今为止规模最大的AAS，代表27个非洲国家和该大陆13个SPP伙伴关系中的9个的约66名参与者。研讨会是美国非洲司令部的一项倡议，将与会者聚集在一起，加强现有的伙伴关系，在非洲高级军事领导人和美国军队之间建立新的关系，并促进关于共同安全问题的讨论，USAWC指挥官约翰・S・凯姆少将说，此次活动还为参与者提供了一个机会，让他们重新审视当前的领导决策模式，并讨论改进这些流程的方法，不仅针对现任领导人，也针对未来的决策者。“我们如何才能以更好的方式做到这一点？因为这是我们所有人都面临的挑战，”他说。“我们都有困难的问题；我们都有问题。我们都有不同或更好的方法。你如何产生一个想法并使其产生影响？这才是我们在这里讨论的真正问题。”美国皇家空军安全合作局局长埃德・威廉姆斯上校（Col.Ed Williams）在开幕式致辞时表示，这项活动是司令部的优先事项，因为全球安全取决于非洲大陆的安全，而非洲大陆的安全需要军事领导人之间建立长期信任和共同目标的伙伴关系。他说：“没有一个安全、稳定和繁荣的非洲，全球安全是不可能的。我们将通过伙伴关系网络共同努力实现这一目标。没有一个国家能够独自做到这一点。这次活动的首要主题是“明天的安全需要今天的领导。”与会者在全体会议和分组会议上讨论了与国防领导力相关的话题，包括军事领导人面临的21世纪挑战、通过国防机构培养领导人以及多国环境下的国防领导力。活动还包括员工乘车前往美国内战战地安提坦国家威廉姆斯鼓励与会者在讨论中坦诚相见，以促进理解和持续的区域合作与协调，确保非洲的稳定与繁荣。他说：“世界是复杂和动态的，非洲军队面临着世界上最多样化的安全挑战：叛乱、武装冲突、非法贩运、海盗、有组织犯罪和暴力极端主义组织。”。“正如你所知，这些威胁是没有边界的――跨越边界、破坏地区稳定，而且往往需要协调的多国反应。军队当然不是非洲的解决方案，但肯定是解决方案的一部分。”

78,ACS seeks volunteers,"By Scott Prater

Mountaineer staff

It’s been a while since Joey Bautista could talk to strangers one-on-one, but April 19, 2021, outside the Commissary, under the shade of an Army Community Service tent, he struck up a conversation with nearly everyone who happened to walk by. Fort Carson’s volunteer services manager and staff at ACS set up an awareness booth near the Commissary exit, in part to recognize National Volunteer Week, but also to ramp up volunteer recruitment efforts. 

After more than a year of stunted operations, many organizations are beginning to open their doors Cand those dependent on volunteers are in dire need. 

“I think we recruited at least 10 in just this one day,” Bautista said. “As things begin to open up again, we have continually more volunteer opportunities.”

Established in 1974, National Volunteer Week recognizes the impact of volunteer service and the power of volunteers to tackle society’s greatest challenges and build stronger communities.

Bautista explained that the week also provides organizations and institutions a chance to reward and recognize their volunteers with in-house ceremonies. 

“It’s an opportunity for Army units, directorates and community partners around Fort Carson to acknowledge people who have been so instrumental in the success of their organizations,” he said. “For instance, Fort Carson ACS hosted its annual volunteer awards ceremony April 20, 2021.” 

Kristen Kea, ACS chief, explained that like many organizations around the world, ACS hasn’t seen many of its volunteers in quite some time. 

“It’s important to reach out to volunteers and highlight what their service means,” she said. “And when volunteers do come back (to an organization) its important for leaders and staff to step in and say thanks.”

Bautista’s volunteer recruitment push continued this week as he and fellow ACS staff visited the Exchange, Evans Army Community Hospital and other high foot-traffic locations, where they explained the benefits of volunteering and relayed information about the latest opportunities.

“A lot of organizations are looking for volunteers now,” Bautista said. “The recreation division is looking to fill volunteer roles before we head into summertime, for example, while Child and Youth Services is looking for coaches for this summer’s sports activities.”

ACS volunteer services also partners with and arranges volunteer opportunities for off-post organizations, like local soup kitchens, Habitat for Humanity, the Humane Society, the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and the Pikes Peak Marathon.

Bautista also announced that volunteer services will host a culminating event at the Elkhorn Conference Center May 12, 2021, where the organization will recognize the installation’s top-notch volunteers, including the volunteer of the year and the youth volunteer of the year.

“Beginning this year, we will also induct two people into the Fort Carson Volunteer Hall of Fame,” he said. “These folks really have no equal. To even qualify for the hall of fame, a person must have earned the volunteer-of-the-year honor three times. It will be special. No other Army installation has a volunteer hall of fame.”

79,TRFB aces audit,"SILVERDALE, Wash. C (Sept. 11, 2020) Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) conducted a Submarine Safety Program (SUBSAFE) Functional Audit (SSFA) of Trident Refit Facility, Bangor (TRFB), Aug. 31 to Sept. 4, 2020.

The audit assessed the internal processes, procedures and controls of all SUBSAFE functional areas including management, quality assurance, reentry control, technical, in-process audit and material, which resulted in TRFB earning satisfactory in all categories.

“It is a great accomplishment for a facility to be satisfactory in all SUBSAFE functional areas,” said Chris McNeil, director of the TRFB SUBSAFE program. “To be satisfactory in all areas demonstrates that the SUBSAFE program pillars are healthy and being adhered to at TRFB.” 

On April 10, 1963, the USS Thresher (SSN 593) sank due to a piping failure during deep-dive tests killing all 129 officers, crewmen and civilian technicians on board, resulting in the establishment of the SUBSAFE program. Since its inception, no SUBSAFE certified U.S. Navy submarine has been lost. 

“[Our success] allows TRFB to continue SUBSAFE work in direct support of the national strategic deterrent mission,” said McNeil. “The men and women of Team TRFB, from the deckplate mechanics to the commanding officer, who execute and exhibit ownership of the SUBSAFE program are a credit to the USS Thresher’s legacy.”
The next SSFA of TRFB will be conducted in 2022.

Trident Refit Facility Bangor (TRFB) was established in the Pacific Northwest on July 1, 1981, as the primary maintenance facility for the West Coast Ballistic Missile Submarine (SSBN) fleet.  TRFB’s principal mission is to support the nation’s strategic deterrence mission by repairing, incrementally overhauling, and modernizing the Ohio-class and the future Columbia-class until the end of service life.

80,Aces return home,"Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS) 373 is an aviation ground support unit, based out of Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California. The squadron is part of Marine Aircraft Group 11 and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.

MWSS-373 returned home to MCAS Miramar, California, April 6, from a six-month deployment operating in Central Command where they supported aerial operations and contributed to the mission success of the flying squadrons in their area of operation.

“We were supporting the [Special Purpose Marine Air-Ground Task Force]-Crisis Response - Central Command,” said Lt. Col. James Bauch, the commanding officer of MWSS-373. “Our primary mission was supporting the airfield and flying squadrons.”

MWSS-373 conducted operations across the 5th Fleet area of operations and were able to exercise all of the capabilities of a Marine Wing Support Squadron in a multitude of different environments.

“Our deployment was extremely successful,” said Bauch. “MWSS-373 supported four flying squadrons in two different locations and were able to push airfield damage repair capabilities the whole six months of our deployment.”

The Marines operating with MWSS-373 covered a range of operations throughout the 52 different military occupational specialties within the squadron, including engineer projects and aircraft recovery. 

“Across the board we were able to exercise all the capabilities an MWSS has in all kinds of different environments.”

Peeler also attributed the success of MWSS-373 to their non-commissioned officer and junior Marines.

“They ran data plans, they were doing grid layouts, electrical interior wiring. You name it, our sergeants were taking care of it,” said Peeler. “We’re going to have a group of sergeants here at MWSS-373 that can actually go back and teach the younger Marines exactly how to do the jobs they need to be prepared for the next rotation of deployments.”

After several months away from home, the Marines of MWSS-373 eagerly walked down the flight line and embraced their families and friends. 

“I think what the squadron learned the most is it really does matter what happens at the staff sergeant and below levels,” said Bauch. “I think what they really came away with is knowing their individual actions within their sections, their platoon and their company, had a great impact on the greater area of operations.”",2018/4/12,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/272902/aces-return-home,"SAN DIEGO, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州圣地亚哥,王牌归来,海军陆战队联队支援中队（MWSS）373是一支航空地面支援部队，总部设在加利福尼亚州米拉玛海军陆战队空军基地。该中队是海军陆战队第11飞机群和第3海军陆战队飞机联队的一部分。MWSS-373于4月6日从中央司令部进行了为期六个月的部署，在那里他们支持空中作战，并为飞行中队在其作战区的任务成功做出了贡献。MWSS-373指挥官詹姆斯・鲍奇中校（James Bauch）说：“我们支持[特殊用途海军陆战队空地特遣部队]――危机应对――中央司令部。我们的主要任务是支持机场和飞行中队。”MWSS-373在第五舰队作战区进行作战，能够在多种不同的环境中发挥海军陆战队联队支援中队的所有能力。“我们的部署非常成功，”Bauch说。“MWSS-373在两个不同的地点支援了四个飞行中队，能够在我们部署的整个六个月内推进机场损坏修复能力。”使用MWSS-373作战的海军陆战队涵盖了中队52个不同军事职业专业的一系列作战，包括工程师项目和飞机回收。“我们能够在各种不同环境中全面发挥MWSS的所有能力。”皮勒还将MWSS-373的成功归功于他们的士官和海军陆战队少校。“他们负责数据规划，他们负责电网布局和内部电气布线。你可以说，我们的中士正在处理这些问题，”皮勒说。“我们将在MWSS-373有一组中士，他们可以回去教年轻的海军陆战队如何为下一轮部署做好准备。”离家数月后，MWSS-373的海军陆战队急切地走下飞行线，拥抱他们的家人和朋友。“我认为中队学到的最多的是，上士及以下级别发生的事情确实很重要，”Bauch说。“我认为他们真正了解的是，他们在部门、排和连内的个人行动对更大的作战区域产生了重大影响。”

by Ms. Kimberly Davidson and Mr. James Christophersen

Late on a January afternoon in Texas in 2015, gunfire shattered the typical silence and echoed through the halls of a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs medical clinic at Fort Bliss. In a scene too familiar to Americans today, active shooter alarms sounded in the William Beaumont Army Medical Center and two nearby schools―thousands of innocent people were suddenly in danger.

Within two minutes of the first shots, a handful of first responders entered the building. Behind the scenes, multiple 911 calls poured in, and the computer-automated dispatch system aided coordination of a swift and decisive response. Within 30 minutes, more than 300 first responders from Fort Bliss' Military Police, the El Paso Police Department, the El Paso SWAT team, the El Paso Independent School District Police Department, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agencies and the FBI had responded.

Equipped with interoperable land mobile radios (LMRs), the diverse team coordinated actions under the direction of a single incident commander. Acting with the efficiency that comes from good communication, the team evacuated more than 3,000 civilians and secured the crime scene in less than seven minutes. Two people were killed. The fast and effective actions of first responders, however, prevented a terrible situation from becoming much worse.

Timeliness is critical during active-shooter incidents to minimize casualties. The ability to communicate in a disaster is one of the most overlooked factors in maximizing the efficiency of response and minimizing damage. LMRs are the first line of communication for first responders at all Army installations. First responders are the heroes; LMRs make the heroes more effective.

‘BEYOND THE BRICK’
Colloquially known as a “brick” for its iconic appearance, the subscriber unit radio―the technical term for the carried or mounted radio unit―is the most visible asset of an LMR system. Most users take no interest in how the system actually works―just as most people don’t think about what goes into making their cellphone work. But unlike a firearm, flashlight or other tool on a first responder’s duty belt, the radio requires a vast behind-the-scenes network to provide state-of-the-art communications capability at the push of a button. Looking beyond the brick reveals the LMR system as a true system of systems, typically consisting of handheld portable radios, mobile radios, base stations, radio towers, software and other network components to extend the range and capability of each radio.

Part of the Program Executive Office for Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), the LMR product office is responsible for the whole system―managing, engineering, acquiring, delivering and supporting the total architecture of the LMR system on Army installations worldwide. In just the continental United States (CONUS), that amounts to 68 stand-alone systems at 68 installations in 38 states and the District of Columbia. The nontactical LMR systems that the product office fields support installation management and force protection, public safety and homeland security. 

A STACKED DECK
In 2014, the LMR product office recognized two mounting threats to the future readiness of Army CONUS LMR systems: a complex requirement and minimally competitive industry base; and a widening shortfall in appropriated funds to procure and sustain aging systems. Similar to many segments of the U.S. defense industrial base, the industry for Army LMR is narrow because few commercial LMR suppliers meet the Army’s information assurance and cybersecurity requirements. Just as Boeing Co., Northrop Grumman Corp. and Lockheed Martin Corp. dominate military aircraft manufacturing, and General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries dominate the Navy shipbuilding market, Harris Corp. and Motorola Solutions Inc. are the dominant competitors for Army LMR.

Although two industry partners generate more competition than one, the modularity and uniqueness of systems for each individual post, camp and station meant that one company would sometimes enjoy a competitive advantage over the other. For example, if the Army used Motorola products at Camp A, it would make the most sense to use products from the same vendor for replacements and upgrades at Camp A for ease of compatibility. That left Harris with an uphill battle to win the contract―which, as the saying goes, often makes the juice not worth the squeeze. In such cases, the competition for a contract evaporated and left one company with a corner on the market.

In a cash-strapped Army, resources directed away from operations and maintenance to meet more urgent readiness requirements and fight existing conflicts left many systems in “break-fix” status, meaning systems were only fixed and restored as they failed. Information assurance accreditations expired at numerous installations, putting long-term operational readiness in jeopardy. Without sufficient funds to maintain all 68 CONUS systems, the LMR product office and its customers, the U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command and the U.S. Installation Management Command, had to look for alternative solutions.

THE ARMY’S ‘ACE’
To solve both issues and ensure readiness for LMR systems, the product office introduced the Army CONUS Enterprise (ACE) LMR System. ACE consolidates 68 localized LMR core systems into two enterprise LMR systems. The ACE model provides fully redundant LMR systems throughout CONUS with a core infrastructure hosted at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington and Fort Drum in upstate New York. 

Here we come to the acquisition card trick. The LMR product office designed the ACE acquisition as a limited-source, dual-award contract with both major contractors―Harris and Motorola―supplying the primary core for one location and the secondary core for the other location. The result? A Motorola primary and Harris secondary at the first location, but a Harris primary and Motorola secondary at the second. The ACE LMR system will provide an enterprise-level LMR system while maintaining competition at the installation level on each delivery order for new radios, towers, dispatch consoles and other infrastructure. With ACE, both major contractors enjoy the same incentive to compete for every LMR procurement for every Army post, camp and station in CONUS, while the Army reaps the benefits of competition.
 
LESSONS LEARNED THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION
In designing the ACE architecture, the LMR product office developed a new contracting model that may prove useful to other network efforts facing challenges with competition. The product office also learned many valuable lessons that are applicable to any office on any effort.

Challenge 1: Communication 
No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy, and no request for proposal (RFP) survives first contact with industry partners. RFPs are prepared deliberately, thoughtfully and thoroughly, but they represent only the government side of the conversation. Government acquisition teams and industry partners both have phenomenal people with brilliant ideas and different perspectives. That often produces different ideas on how to solve the same problem. By communicating first, frequently and openly, government and industry partners can better complement one another's efforts.

When issuing its RFP, the product office was confident that its industry partners would repurpose existing core systems from current installations to the new ACE sites to save on costs. They were then shocked to learn through initial industry proposals that none of the fielded cores was technically suitable to handle the volume of traffic required for a regional core. Both government and industry partners were in sync on the big picture, but they found key differences in proposed solutions.

The product office plans to mitigate confusion on task orders for individual site installations by using face-to-face initial proposal meetings with industry to discuss, clarify and shape proposals through dialogue. Rather than asking the companies to prepare their proposals in a vacuum as with the initial RFP, the product office is putting the “partner” back in “industry partner” and collaborating to provide best-value solutions.

Challenge 2: Acquisition Agility
In a joint statement Sept. 27, 2017, to the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces, Lt. Gen. Bruce T. Crawford, Army chief information officer/G-6, Maj. Gen. James J. Mingus, director of the Mission Command Center of Excellence, and Gary Martin, program executive officer for Command, Control and Communications C Tactical, stated, ""Our current acquisition process does not allow the Army to rapidly acquire and integrate emerging capabilities, allowing the warfighter to keep pace with technology and stay ahead of the evolving threat."" 

Although their statement was directed to tactical networks, the same challenge is aptly illustrated by ACE LMR. Building newer, more resilient and reliable systems requires time, especially for modern communications systems. To go from concept to contract for ACE took 3 1/2 years. Now in post-award, the product office projects another 18 months to deliver the first installations. Updating all 68 CONUS LMR systems will continue incrementally over the next five to 10 years as funding priorities permit. That totals 10 to 15 years from concept to completed fielding. As ACE LMR illustrates, the Army acquisition machinery is a battleship that cannot abruptly change direction. Major network improvements do not happen overnight.

Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark A. Milley has identified readiness as his No. 1 priority and devoted specific attention to the Army’s communications networks. Time and long-range planning are necessities to achieve Armywide readiness. As it plans regionalization efforts for Army installations in Europe and the Pacific, the LMR product office is applying lessons from ACE to streamline those acquisitions.

CONCLUSION
Through it all, the LMR product office demonstrated that a small, dedicated team of acquisition experts―six people in all―accustomed to the routine of cookie-cutter acquisitions can adapt to create something completely new. Without adding any new staff, the team drew on its familiarity with the product and the industry to develop and implement innovative solutions that will fundamentally alter the Army’s future LMR acquisitions. Their dedication and focus will produce three distinct benefits for the Army:

The Army will enjoy immediate cost savings: At a unit price of $800,000 to $1 million per core, a reduction of 64 cores suggests a conservative cost savings estimate of $51.2 million for the cost of the systems alone.

The Army anticipates additional life cycle savings through reduced operations and maintenance (O&M) costs: Acquisition theory teaches program managers to plan for 60 percent of the cost of a product over the life cycle to fall into O&M. The bulk of the savings is realized years after installation. The Army expects to realize a cost avoidance by reducing the number of O&M contracts from 75 to two. Additionally, O&M costs will be further reduced by decreased redundancy in site surveys, operations, information assurance accreditation, software updates and maintenance.

ACE LMR reduces workload and improves readiness: On many Army installations, support for fielded LMR systems is not a primary duty. The system manager typically has one, two or even three other primary duties. The burden of programming radios, updating software and other O&M efforts for LMR often competes with unrelated duties, leaving resources strained. ACE reduces the workload for system managers by centralizing many tasks and assigning them to dedicated system managers based at the two core sites. Reducing the hands-on labor required to manage and maintain the fielded systems improves readiness and resiliency for first-responder communications.

JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, Va. - Half-a-century has never looked so good!

Army Community Service was designed to provide a framework for the operation of a viable system of social services within the Army community and was “born” July 25, 1965, when Gen. Harold K. Johnson, then-Army chief of staff, sent a letter to all commanders announcing the approval and establishment of ACS, according to an article on Army.mil. With the publication of Army Regulation 608-1 on Nov. 19, 1965, ACS was formalized. 

ACS opened its doors on the Fort Myer portion of the joint base in the spring of 1966, according to ACS Chief Laurie Brown. By 1967, a majority of continental U.S. Army installations had initiated ACS centers. 

Programs such as the Handicapped Dependents Program (now the Exceptional Family Member Program) and the Child Advocacy Program (now the Family Advocacy Program) were created in the years from 1965 to 1981. A revised version of AR 608-1, released Oct. 1, 1978, made budget counseling, debt liquidation and relocation assistance part of the program. In addition, the Army Child Advocacy Program was incorporated into ACS and the Army Child Support Services Program was established. 

In 1983, then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. John A. Wickham Jr., wrote a white paper entitled “The Army Family” that addressed how the support of family members was critical to the Army’s mission. That paper led to the Army Family Action Plan, an initiative that identifies and prioritizes quality of life issues for Soldiers and their families at the grassroots level. 

In 1988, the Relocation Assistance Program was officially established by a Department of Defense Instruction and further mandated by public law in 1989. ACS also operates the Relocation Assistance Program, the Consumer Affairs and Financial Assistance Program, the Family Member Employment Assistance Program, the Volunteer Program, the Exceptional Family Member Program, the Family Advocacy Program, the Outreach Program, and the Information, Referral, and Follow-up Program.

ACS responded to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan by developing Soldier and Family Assistance Centers in 2007. In 2008, Survivor Outreach Services was established as a means to support and incorporate survivors of deceased service members into the Army family.

ACS can be found online at www.armyonesource.com, which was launched in 2008.

85,It takes a village to perfect ACE,"Through hard work and rigorous training, members of the 633rd Air Base Wing, 1st Fighter Wing, 192nd Wing, and Missouri Air National Guard completed a week-long Agile Combat Employment exercise Jan. 11-15 at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Virginia.

With the ever-changing landscape of combat, the Air force must adapt to meet the demand for current and future military operations. 

During this exercise, the 27th Fighter Squadron planned and led various training activities to help Airmen hone their skills on various tasks required of them for the new shift in combat employment. 

In the past, the Air Force would deploy a large contingency of aircraft to support operations around the globe. While that is still a possibility, ACE focuses on being able to rapidly deploy a smaller size force. To provide air dominance in support of military operations around the globe with a responsive tactical force, practicing ACE tactics are paramount for units.

Throughout the week-long exercise, these units practiced equipment and personnel transportation, loading weapons onto U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptors for rapid deployment, and small troop mobilization to help enhance their overall effectiveness in a combat situation.

“Today we’re going to see the ammo and weapons troops come out and practice loading and offloading the aircraft with their equipment that is specialized to this mission and configure their equipment to our aircraft,” said U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Michael Mears, 139th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron crew chief. “We are going to test and see what our limits are and what we need to change, making sure that we’re checking all boxes safely and getting through the exercise so that we can give leadership good information to make better decisions.”

According to U.S. Air Force Capt. Andrew Gibler, 27th Fighter Squadron director of maintenance, this exercise simulated a real-world scenario for crews utilizing ACE for operations. The jets would land in a simulated austere environment, ground crews would refuel and reload the aircraft, and quickly turn them around so they can rapidly support another mission.

“This is one of the first times we’ve had the ability to actually practice this in conjunction with loading munitions on the ground,” Gibler said. “This is an awesome opportunity for us to see what it would be like, and so far we are beating our expectations and are already finding several ways to increase our efficiency.”

As ACE is an Air Force-wide initiative, there is an emphasis on several different units working in conjunction to help improve effectiveness throughout. 

“It’s important for us because everything that we do on our side of the fence is together,” Gibler said. “This is a one team, one fight mentality for us; being able come out and see everyone participate and work together is proof of how awesome our teams are.” 

Maintenance crews were not the only ones to benefit from this ACE exercise. Pilots for the U.S. Air Force F-22 Raptor and the C-130 Hercules aircraft played vital roles. The C-130s provided by the Missouri Air National Guard helped to transport equipment and crews from JBLE to support the F-22s from the 1st FW.

The implementation of ACE is a strategy that is helping to evolve the Air Force and its operations. With ACE in place, the Air Force is continually adapting to provide air dominance and support to military operations around the globe.",2021/3/23,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/392116/takes-village-perfect-ace,"JOINT BASE LANGLEY-EUSTIS, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州兰利-尤斯蒂斯联合基地,需要一个村庄来完善王牌,经过艰苦的工作和严格的训练，633空军基地联队、第一战斗机联队、192联队和密苏里州空军国民警卫队的成员于1月11日至15日在弗吉尼亚州兰利・尤斯蒂斯联合基地完成了为期一周的敏捷战斗使用演习。在不断变化的战斗环境中，空军必须适应当前和未来军事行动的需求。在这次演习中，第27战斗机中队计划并领导了各种训练活动，以帮助飞行员磨练他们在新的作战使用转变所需的各种任务中的技能。过去，空军将部署大量应急飞机，以支持全球作战。尽管这仍然是一种可能性，ACE专注于能够快速部署规模较小的部队。为了以反应灵敏的战术部队为全球军事行动提供空中优势支持，对部队来说，练习ACE战术至关重要。在为期一周的演习中，这些部队练习设备和人员运输，将武器装载到美国空军F-22猛禽机上进行快速部署，“今天，我们将看到弹药和武器部队出来，用他们专门用于这项任务的设备来练习装载和卸载飞机，并将他们的设备配置到我们的飞机上，”美国空军第139飞机维修中队机长迈克尔・米尔斯中士说。美国空军第27战斗机中队维修总监安德鲁・吉布勒上尉说：“我们将测试并看看我们的极限是什么，我们需要改变什么，确保我们安全地检查所有箱子，并通过演习，以便我们能够为领导层提供好的信息，从而做出更好的决策。”，该演习模拟了机组人员利用ACE进行操作的真实场景。这些飞机将在模拟恶劣的环境中着陆，地勤人员将为飞机加油和重新装填弹药，并迅速使其掉头，以便能够快速支持另一项任务。“这是我们第一次有能力在地面装填弹药的同时实现这一点，”吉布勒说。“这对我们来说是一个非常好的机会，让我们看看它会是什么样子，到目前为止，我们已经超出了我们的预期，并且已经找到了几种方法来提高我们的效率。”由于ACE是一项空军范围的计划，因此强调了几个不同的单位协同工作，以帮助提高整个过程的效率。吉布勒说：“这对我们很重要，因为我们所做的一切都是团结在一起的。”。“这对我们来说是一个团队，一个战斗的心态；能够站出来看到每个人都参与并一起工作证明了我们的团队是多么出色。”维修人员并不是唯一从这项ACE练习中受益的人。美国空军F-22猛禽和C-130大力士飞机的飞行员发挥了至关重要的作用。密苏里州空军国民警卫队提供的C-130帮助从JBLE运送设备和机组人员，以支持第一FW的F-22。ACE的实施是一项有助于空军及其作战发展的战略。随着ACE的到位，空军正在不断适应为全球军事行动提供空中优势和支持。
86,ACS Annex announces changes,"By Scott Prater

Mountaineer staff

FORT CARSON, Colo. ― Army Community Service (ACS) at Fort Carson officially renamed one of its predominant facilities recently. What was formerly known as the Soldier and Family Assistance Center (SFAC), building 7492 near Titus Boulevard and Sheridan Avenue, is now known as the ACS Annex. 

Several factors went into renaming the facility, a former child development center that was constructed in 2010 and features a modern architecture with abundant natural light, spacious meeting areas, vaulted ceilings, classrooms and playgrounds. 

As part of the transition, ACS’s Family Nurturing Center moved into the building from its former offices in building 1354. 

“The ACS Annex just has better amenities for children,” said Rhea Rollman, ACS social science program specialist and annex director. “The Family Nurturing Center staff moved over in mid-December and started its program service Jan. 6, 2020. Since then, we’ve seen a vast improvement in the number of Families coming to the Family Nurturing Center.”

Additional facility moves are planned for ACS in the months to come. The moves are an effort to modernize facility spaces and provide welcoming spaces for Soldiers and Families. 

“This action is part of our space utilization plan,” said Kristen Kea, ACS division chief. “It will allow us to realign our services and put our Family Nurturing Center in close proximity to housing. And since its in the Evans (Army Community Hospital) footprint, it will make it easier for parents to find.”

Kea indicated ACS services at Fort Carson will transition from five buildings, down to three and will announce additional realignment steps soon. The organization has already closed its ACS Community Connections, building 1524, and moved staff into the main ACS, building 1526.

87,Paratroopers train to ace the ACFT,"FORT BRAGG, N.C. -- Early in the morning, October 2nd, 2019, Paratroopers of the 82nd Brigade Support Battalion, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division, warmed up in preparation for the Army Combat Fitness Test, or ACFT, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. For many of the Paratroopers here, this was their first time taking the new test.

Within the 82nd Brigade Support Battalion, connecting fitness with combat readiness helps improve the unit as a whole. Combat readiness is especially important to the Paratroopers here, with the majority of the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, or “Panther Brigade”, deployed in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel.

The ACFT measures a Soldier’s strength and endurance with six events: three-repetition maximum deadlift, standing power throw, hand-release push-ups, leg tuck, sprint-drag-carry, and a two-mile run.

“For me the most difficult part was the sprint-drag-carry,” said Staff Sgt. Bryan Tramell. “The AFCT is a full body workout that tests your left and right limits. It’s definitely a challenge compared to the APFT.”

The ACFT will be the Army’s required fitness test for all Soldiers by October 1st, 2020. The current three event APFT remains the test of record, during the transition period.

For the trainers here at the Panther Brigade, the ACFT provides a better evaluative tool for fitness, but also a logistical challenge, explained Staff Sgt. Jason Conley. Between equipment and man-power, it takes a lot longer to set up than the APFT, which had little to no requirements. For this Paratrooper however, it’s all worth it.

“I think it’s going to change the Army 100 percent,” said Conley. “It’s going to open a lot of people’s eyes to their fitness level. The ACFT testing six different events should be a max of 70 minutes. A lot of people that go to the gym will excel at certain portions of the ACFT, but if you’re truly combat ready we need you to be able to lift a load, sprint and have endurance.”

The age and gender-neutral ACFT will prepare all Soldiers for the occupational demands of combat, something every Paratrooper here knows could soon be their reality. 

Later this year, units throughout the 82nd Airborne Division will be issued, ""Gyms in a Box."" These vital fitness equipment sets will enhance Paratrooper’s overall physical training plans, and help improve their ACFT performance.",2019/10/2,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/345506/paratroopers-train-ace-acft,"FORT BRAGG, NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国北卡罗来纳州布拉格堡,伞兵训练成为美国空军司令部的王牌,布拉格堡，北卡罗来纳州――2019年10月2日清晨，第82空降师第3旅战斗队第82旅支援营的伞兵在北卡罗来纳州布拉格堡为陆军战斗体能测试（ACFT）做准备。对于这里的许多伞兵来说，这是他们第一次参加新的测试。在第82旅支援营中，将体能与战备状态联系起来有助于提高部队整体素质。战斗准备对这里的伞兵尤其重要，第三旅战斗队或“黑豹旅”的大部分人员都部署在支持“自由行动”哨兵的地方。ACFT通过六个项目来衡量士兵的力量和耐力：三次重复的最大仰卧起坐、站立力量投掷、手放松俯卧撑、，腿部抱膝、短跑拖带和两英里跑。“对我来说，最困难的部分是短跑拖带，”参谋中士布莱恩・特拉梅尔说。“AFCT是一项测试左右极限的全身训练。与APFT相比，它无疑是一项挑战。”到2020年10月1日，ACFT将成为陆军要求的所有士兵的体能测试。在过渡期间，目前的三项APFT仍然是记录的测试。对于黑豹旅的训练员来说，ACFT提供了一个更好的健身评估工具，但也是一个后勤挑战，参谋长Jason Conley解释道。在设备和人力之间，设置需要比APFT更长的时间，后者几乎没有要求。然而，对于这位伞兵来说，这一切都是值得的。“我认为这将100%地改变军队，”康利说。“这将让很多人看到他们的体能水平。ACFT测试六个不同项目的时间最长应为70分钟。很多去健身房的人将在ACFT的某些部分表现出色，但如果你真的做好了战斗准备，我们需要你能够提举负载、冲刺和耐力。”年龄和性别中立的ACFT将使所有士兵为战斗的职业需求做好准备，这里的每个伞兵都知道这可能很快成为他们的现实。今年晚些时候，整个第82空降师的部队将被发布“盒子里的健身房”。这些重要的健身器材将加强伞兵的整体体能训练计划，并有助于提高他们的ACFT表现。
88,Coupons gone crazy at ACS,"Fort Jackson’s Army Community Service welcomed Cassandra McNeal-Harris as she taught military Families how to save hundreds or thousands of dollars using coupons in a workshop on Sept. 10. She even taught a few handy tricks on how to double or triple savings using not only paper coupons, but digital coupons and smartphone apps as well.

“It takes a lot of practice and depends on the store and cashier,” McNeal-Harris said. “It gets easier but they have more guidelines than they did before.”

Those guidelines she spoke about are essential to maximize savings when using coupons. She explained how each store has it’s own policy regarding the number of coupons that can be accepted for specific items at one time and whether or not a certain store offers double or triple coupon values on certain days. 

“Couponing requires time, discipline and organization,” she said.

McNeal-Harris said how coupons are available from a variety of sources that include the internet, friends and Family members, newspapers, tear pads found in the grocery store and “peelies” which are coupons that are found on products provided by the vendor. 

She passed a large green binder throughout the class to demonstrate her organization technique for coupons she frequently uses. One attendee, Kimberly Henry, was gifted a new coupon binder of her own for being the first to take her seat for the workshop. 

ble you get with it,” she said.

McNeal-Harris also talked about building a stockpile. While the term stock pile may sound familiar to TV watchers and disaster preppers, she encouraged to start slowly building a stock pile of items a household uses daily. This can include paper products such as toilet paper and paper towels, cleaning supplies and pet food and treats. She encouraged the class to buy for the future and know how much product the household uses and when too much has been accumulated, donate it.

She spoke about school supplies she had stockpiled throughout the year and how she then donated them to her extended Family members and her local church. 

McNeal-Harris explained how easily it is to be fooled while shopping by store promotions such as 10 for $10 deals and bigger is not necessarily better. She said it can be easy  to get caught up in a savings deal by purchasing 10 of certain items for $10 when the items are normally only a dollar when purchased alone and that buying a larger size product is not always cheaper than purchasing a smaller version of the same product. 

She also encouraged shoppers to make sure and check your receipts for any errors or over charges. 

After couponing for more than 10 years, McNeal-Harris said she and her husband are able to travel throughout the year using the savings she gets from coupon shopping. Her adventures include traveling, purchasing

89,ACES RED launches to ISS,"REDSTONE ARSENAL, Alabama C The U.S. Army is all ACES as it continues to blaze a trail for the future use of space.

The Army Cost Efficient Spaceflight Research Experiments and Demonstrations, or ACES RED, Attitude Determination and Control System, or ADCS, Flyer was launched to the International Space Station aboard the Falcon 9 SpaceX Commercial Resupply Services 17 from Cape Canaveral, Florida, May 4. Once it reaches the International Space Station it will be attached to the outside of the ISS to begin 12 months of data collection.

“We are very excited about the launch. It has been a long time coming,” said Rebecca Eade, ACES RED project lead. “This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience to get to sit here with NASA and watch a rocket go off, especially knowing there is something you have had an impact on that is going into space. It’s not something that everybody gets to do so it’s kind of a big deal.”

The U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command Technical Center’s Space Systems Division developed the ACES RED project to examine the performance of attitude determination, attitude control, flight computers, and other low-cost, commercial-off-the-shelf, or COTS, systems in a space environment. ACES RED was designed, fabricated and assembled in the Tech Center’s Concepts Analysis Laboratory and will be mounted to the ISS where it will transmit experimentation data to a manned operations center at Redstone Arsenal.

“This is a science experiment and we have mostly undergraduate and graduate students working on it,” Eade said. “It is a really cool experiment that uses COTS items that are not flight-graded and we are trying to prove out that you can use certain components in space.”

Through ACES RED, the Army is looking to drive down cost and risk of equipment while potentially qualifying parts with a technology readiness level suitable for space use in future small satellites. It will be capable of supporting multiple simultaneous experiments with its modular “plug-in” design. ACES RED is designed similarly to the motherboard of a personal computer, which allows for the easy removal and replacement of experiments.

To accomplish the goals of the ACES RED team, they are receiving support from Radiance Technologies and the University of Alabama in Huntsville, or UAH, System Management and Production Center. The team is almost entirely composed of young engineers, college students and recent college graduates under the close supervision of government engineers and contractors.

“We are going to put something up on the ISS and not many people can say that,” said Andrew Webb, a UAH graduate student and software engineer. “We are also testing a lot of new things that no one has ever flown before, and to be able to do that coming right out of college is really cool.

“I’ve always worked with software but when I first came here we were working with hardware and getting the software to work with the hardware first,” he added. “I have gradually migrated to the ground-station software that we recently developed.”

The ACES RED experiment looks to quickly mature various COTS technologies that will reduce the cost and complexity as well as maintain the performance of future Army small satellites. One of the advantages to the SMDC designed system is that most of the parts that will be going to space were assembled or modified right here on Redstone Arsenal by in-house engineers.

ACES RED serves as a pilot program to build up test capabilities for space hardware to gain future capabilities such as more refined attitude determination and control for satellites to help orient them when in space, as well as taking industrial-grade computers and testing them in a space environment.

Its main technical goal is to solve vectoring problem solutions by implementing multiple sensors in various combinations or configurations. ACES RED’s secondary objectives include maturation of non-traditional and COTS industrial-grade components in place of traditionally hardened space-rated systems, which are vastly more expensive such as flight computers, memory devices, imaging sensors and attitude determination devices.

91,144th FW Aces AFOA,"Inspectors from 1st AF specifically
looked at the 144th FW’s maintenance,
operations, command post and security
forces.

“The 144th FW alert force did an
outstanding job in the AFOA,” said U.S.
Air Force Maj. Jonathan Burd, 144th
Fighter Wing alert officer in charge.
“The alert aircraft inspected were found
to have zero deficiencies, which is an
unheard of success in an inspection,
where almost every working part of the
aircraft is evaluated. But there is always
room for improvement, and the AFOA
inspectors offered valuable techniques
to better certain areas.”

Burd commended the alert personnel
for their effort to make these
improvements.

“I was most impressed with the desire
to improve the alert maintenance
shifts,” Burd said. “They took all
feedback with no arguments, and
earnestly worked to improve their
techniques and procedures.”

On the flying side, the 144th FW alert
pilots met all airborne taskings with
flying colors, receiving a commendation
from the inspectors in the area of
tactical execution, once again proving
that the 144th FW executes at a level
above both peers and adversaries.

Operating on a 24-month cycle,
the AFOA acts as the preliminary
assessment before North American
Aerospace Defense Command conducts
the Alert Force Evaluation. The AFE is
an unannounced evaluation which can
occur during a three-month window,
which begins in August 2016 for the
144th FW.

“While it is important to do well in this
inspection, the AFE is on the horizon,”
Burd said. “This evaluation will occur
while most of the wing will be deployed
overseas, which means resources and
manning will be stretched thin. Despite
these challenges, the AFOA results
proved that the wing is ready to execute
its next inspection with success.”

Special recognition goes to the alert
maintenance personnel who prepared,
inspected, repaired, armed, and
properly documented all items on the
F-15 Eagles in the alert barns.

“Tech. Sgt. David Minnich, 144th
Maintenance Squadron crew chief, led
his shift to the AFOA win,” Burd said.
“Additionally, the alert force is currently
without a chief enlisted manager, but
those duties were expertly performed
by Master Sgt. Jeffrey Pfeifer, 144th
FW alert maintenance superintendent,
in addition to his normal supervision
duties. His preparation and execution
directly led to mission success.”

Both alert maintenance personnel and
pilots contribute many days away from
family in order to keep the alert mission
going.

“It is important to remember that these
individuals spend a lot of time away
from their families in order to protect
our nation’s west coast 24/7/365,” Burd
said. “Their commitment to the mission
goes a long way.”",2016/5/25,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/200211/144th-fw-aces-afoa,"FRESNO, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],弗雷斯诺，加利福尼亚州，美国,第144届FW Aces AFOA,第144战斗机联队警戒官员、美国空军少校乔纳森・伯德（Jonathan Burd）说：“第144战斗机联队警戒部队在AFOA中做了一项杰出的工作。”。“被检查的警戒飞机被发现没有缺陷，这是一次成功的检查，几乎对飞机的每一个工作部件都进行了评估。但总有改进的余地，而且上述检查人员提供了有价值的技术来改进某些领域。”Burd赞扬了警报人员做出这些改进的努力。“我对改进警报维护换班的愿望印象最深，”Burd说。“他们毫无争议地接受了所有反馈，并认真地改进了他们的技术和程序。”在飞行方面，第144飞行警备队飞行员出色地完成了所有空降任务，在执行任务方面获得了检查员的表扬，再次证明第144飞行警备队执行任务的水平高于同行和对手。AFOA以24个月为一个周期，作为在北美之前的初步评估nAerospace国防司令部进行了警戒部队评估。AFE是一项未经宣布的评估，将在2016年8月开始的第144届FW的三个月时间内进行。伯德说：“尽管做好这项检查很重要，但AFE正在进行中。”。“该评估将在大部分机翼部署到海外时进行，这意味着资源和人员将被压缩。尽管存在这些挑战，AFOA的结果证明机翼已准备好成功执行下一次检查。”特别要表扬的是负责准备、检查、维修、武装和正确记录警戒仓中OFF-15鹰上所有物品的警戒维修人员。“144维修中队队长大卫・明尼奇中士带领他的班次前往AFOA胜利号，”伯德说。“此外，警备部队目前没有一名总入伍经理，但除了正常的监督职责外，这些职责由144 THFW警备维修总监杰弗里・普费弗上士熟练执行。他的准备和执行直接导致了任务的成功。”为了保持警戒任务的持续进行，警戒维修人员和飞行员都会远离家人很多天。“重要的是要记住，这些人会花很多时间远离家人，以保护我们国家的西海岸，365年7月24日，”Burdsaid说。“他们对任务的承诺是很长的。”
92,JBER executes ACE at King Salmon,"Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson’s 3rd Wing expanded their Agile Combat Employment (ACE) capabilities as part of Polar Force 21-5 from April 2 to 9 at King Salmon Air Force Station, Alaska.

Polar Force 21-5 is a simulated deployment to hone ACE skills. King Salmon Air Force Station was used to practice the ACE concept and expand the use of 3rd Wing’s resources. 

U.S. Air Force Col. Travolis Simmons, the 3rd Wing commander, said the exercise at King Salmon was very successful. 

“We made tremendous strides maturing ACE during our spring readiness exercise,” said Simmons. “PACAF leadership asked the Wings to expand the envelope of what we can do every time we practice ACE, and we absolutely achieved that this week. Our Airmen performed brilliantly and the leadership team learned a great deal about the command and control in the ACE environment. This exercise represented another significant step in our quest to accelerate change.”  

The use of King Salmon Air Force Station creates a larger span of air dominance and flexibility during crisis scenarios. 

Regarding the importance of maturing forward operating locations, Simmons said, “In addition to enhancing our ACE capability, conducting operations at King Salmon enhances our ability to maintain continuity of operations in the event of a natural disaster or similar scenario. Sites like King Salmon extend our readiness to support the no-fail support homeland defense mission as well respond to US INDOPACOM taskings.” 

Alaska provides the perfect strategic location for the U.S. Air Force to quickly respond to foreign threats or emergencies.  

“King Salmon provided an excellent training area for Agile Combat Employment fundamentals,” said U.S. Air Force Lt. Col. Matthew Tromans, director of the 3rd Wing ACE Cell. “Its remote location and inherent communication difficulties forced us to work through a myriad of primary and backup plans. The joint effort realized by the combined 3rd Wing and 673d Air Base Wing ACE detachment made tremendous strides in proving the PACAF agile combat employment concept.”

ACE’s mission can’t be completed without Air Force personnel, but mission partners also play a key role in supporting our day-to-day work and training efforts. 

“This event would not have been possible without the support of the King Salmon airport authorities and Air Force Station partners,"" Tromans said. “Those partnerships help the 3rd Wing normalize King Salmon operations, building confidence in its use as an F-22 Raptor weather alternate, and increases the opportunity for training sorties during the winter months which often have high rates of weather attrition.”

93,123rd ACS realigns with the 178th Wing,"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio-- This month, the 123rd Air Control Squadron realigned with the 178th Wing. Previously a tenant unit, the 123rd ACS became a squadron of the 178th Wing and now falls under the Wing’s command structure. 

The 123rd ACS was established in 1946 at the Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio. Over the past 70 years, their mission has remained largely unchanged. The mission of the 123rd ACS is to provide command and control capabilities to assist ground forces commanders in control of regional airspace. The capabilities they provide allow the commanders to direct joint service aircraft and assists in planning, requesting, coordinating and controlling close air operations, intelligence gathering and airlift. 

“The 123rd ACS is fully equipped to drop into a bare base and set up to provide air control to a combat environment,” said Col. Kimberly A. Fitzgerald, the commander of the 178th Wing. “Besides the controllers, they have every training and specialty they need to sustain themselves such as food services, security, transportation, logistics, technical radar operators and maintenance. On a more complex level, they direct defensive and offensive air missions and can be tasked to direct air defense and airspace management activities. They provide an integrated air picture and theater missile defense warning to combatant commanders.”

Before the realignment, the Wing provided support to the 123rd ACS through providing the unit with funding, promotions, and manning. The 123rd ACS’s chain of command was through State Headquarters and they did not fall under one of the four Wings in the Ohio National Guard.

“In the future now, all of the support we provide for them will remain the same,” said Fitzgerald. “We will still support them and now the chain of command will come through us as well.”

The decision to realign the unit with the 178th Wing was a strategic move. With the Space Force National Guard looming on the horizon, the 178th Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance Group may transition to the new service. With that transition, the Wing would not have enough people to maintain its status as a Wing. Realigning the 123rd ACS will give the Wing enough personnel to remain a Wing in the case of the 178th ISRG transitioning to the Space Force National Guard.

Although this realignment has great benefits to the Wing and the Ohio National Guard, it is also extremely beneficial to the Airmen of 123rd ACS. 

“The benefits of the realignment are for the people of the 123rd ACS, I think,” said Fitzgerald. “Now the Airmen get to compete for Wing level awards. They also get to compete for stratifications on their performance reports which will help when they are trying to get development opportunities.”

The realignment also provides the 123rd ACS with a Wing Commander who can advocate for their Airmen and mission at the National level. 

“We go to the Guard Bureau often and we talk about missions here at the 178th Wing,” said Fitzgerald. “In the past, we didn’t talk about the 123rd ACS [at the Bureau] because they were not in our chain of command. Now going forward, we’ll be advocating for them.”  

The 178th Wing not only gains a unit and their mission capabilities, but the Wing gains nearly 200 Airmen to immerse into the Saber family. 

“We are happy to officially invite the 123rd ACS team into the 178th Wing Saber family,” said Fitzgerald. “It seems like un-officially it has always been the case so we are glad it is finally formalized.”",2021/1/19,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/387162/123rd-acs-realigns-with-178th-wing,"SPRINGFIELD-BECKLEY AIR GUARD STATION, OH, UNITED STATES",[],[],斯普林菲尔德-贝克利空军警卫站，俄亥俄州，美国,第123届ACS与第178联队重新会师,俄亥俄州斯普林菲尔德――本月，第123空中控制中队与第178联队重新会师。先前是一个租户单位，第123 ACS成为178联队的一个中队，现在隶属于联队的指挥结构。第123届ACS于1946年在俄亥俄州辛辛那提的伦肯机场成立。在过去70年中，他们的使命基本上没有改变。第123ACS的任务是提供指挥和控制能力，以协助地面部队指挥官控制区域空域。它们提供的能力使指挥官能够指挥联合军机，并协助规划、请求、协调和控制近距离空中行动、情报收集和空运。178联队指挥官金伯利・a・菲茨杰拉德上校说：“第123装甲部队装备齐全，可以空降到一个空旷的基地，为作战环境提供空中控制。”。“除了管制员外，他们还拥有维持自身生存所需的所有培训和专业技能，如食品服务、安全、运输、后勤、技术雷达操作员和维修。在更复杂的层面上，他们指挥防御和进攻性空中任务，并可负责指导防空和空域管理活动s、 他们向作战指挥官提供综合空中图像和战区导弹防御警告。”在重新调整前，联队通过向部队提供资金、晋升和人员配备，为第123 ACS提供支持。第123届ACS的指挥链是通过州总部进行的，他们不属于俄亥俄州国民警卫队的四个分支之一。菲茨杰拉德说：“今后，我们为他们提供的所有支持都将保持不变。”。“我们仍将支持他们，现在指挥链也将通过我们。”将部队与第178联队重新组合的决定是一项战略举措。随着航天部队国民警卫队即将成立，第178情报、监视、侦察小组可能会过渡到新的军种。随着这一过渡，联队将没有足够的人员维持其联队的地位。重新调整第123航空队将使联队有足够的人员在第178 ISRG过渡到航天部队国民警卫队的情况下继续担任联队。虽然这种调整对联队和俄亥俄州国民警卫队有很大好处，但对第123航空队的飞行员也极为有利。菲茨杰拉德说：“我认为，重组的好处在于第123届ACS的人民。”。“现在，飞行员们可以竞争机翼级别的奖项。他们还可以竞争绩效报告的分层，这将有助于他们获得发展机会。”此次调整还为第123届ACS提供了一名机翼指挥官，该指挥官可以在国家一级为他们的飞行员和任务辩护。菲茨杰拉德说：“我们经常去警卫局，我们在178楼谈论任务。”。“过去，我们没有谈论第123航空队（在局里），因为他们不在我们的指挥范围内。现在，我们将为他们鼓吹。”178联队不仅获得了一支部队和他们的任务能力，而且还获得了近200名飞行员，以融入军刀家族。菲茨杰拉德说：“我们很高兴正式邀请第123支ACS团队加入第178支Wing Saber家族。”。“联合国官方似乎一直如此，所以我们很高兴它最终正式化。”
94,729th ACS goes to DIRT school,"A ground burst simulator blast cracks through the crisp fall air. Airmen train their M4 Carbines on an opposing force running for the base perimeter. Simulated rounds echo in reply as small fire teams communicate enemy activity via tactical radios and direct a quick reaction force towards the intruder’s position.

The attack is repelled, but trainers and medical personnel quickly swoop in to report there are two simulated wounded warriors. The trainers monitor the care under fire and Self-Aid Buddy Care actions.

After the Airmen are moved to safety, the scenario fights on during the fourth iteration of the 729th Air Control Squadron’s “DIRT Days,” a 48-hour training exercise.

DIRT, which stands for Deployment Initial Readiness Training, teaches Airman from the Control and Reporting Center of 729th ACS and the 726th ACS at Mountain Home AFB, Idaho, convoy operations, field living, small arms skills, defensive site preparation, radio communication, SABC under fire, and other readiness skills.

Coming on the heels of an emerging requirement for a more mobile and ready command and control anywhere in the world, the two CRCs under the command of the 552nd Air Control Group at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, have been working since spring on standardizing and training an organic teams of experts.

These experts train first-time CRC deployers, as well as refresh more experienced unit members on field skills and operating CRC equipment in expeditionary locations.

After years of being tasked to U.S. Central Command and familiar bases, CRC units are brushing up on fundamentals and reactivating a flexible mentality as they train and prepare to deploy anywhere they are needed for world-class command and control.

Since the advent of COVID-19, the CRC DIRT cadre leaders innovated a class size and schedule that allowed for distance learning academics, small team training, and flexible 48-hour practical training exercises.

There was a DIRT Honcho leadership class held for officers and senior non-commissioned officers focused on leading CRC units and movement of equipment anywhere needed on the globe while the DIRT Trooper course trained young officers and Airman practical execution of skills in a expeditionary role.

“I tell each class our purpose is to be ready and respond at a moment’s notice to any emerging contingencies worldwide,” said Master Sgt. Matthew West, 729th ACS’s NCO in charge.

New training on threats like cyber, electromagnetic spectrum operations, and small unmanned aerial vehicles have or will be implemented in upcoming exercises. Each 48-hour DIRT iteration is debriefed and modified based off real world and student feedback, as well as refinements from other units and enabling base agencies.

“We need to have our Airmen ready to support global contingency operations at all times,” said Maj. Josiah Swim, assistant director. “The fundamental field skills at DIRT school are critical to preparing our Airmen’s mindset for deploying to remote locations.”

Swim said taking time each month to consistently train and debrief practical scenarios goes a long way to improving the agility of the CRC community and making sure America’s investment in world class command and control, anytime, anyplace, is assured.

“The 729th is truly amazing,” he said. “Combined efforts allow a mobile command and control asset of the theater air control system that gives 24-hour, persistent options to combatant commanders all over the globe.”",2020/11/5,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/382454/729th-acs-goes-dirt-school,"HILL AIR FORCE BASE, UT, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国犹他州希尔空军基地,第729届ACS进入泥土学校,一个地面爆炸模拟器在清新的秋风中爆炸。飞行员在向基地外围跑去的敌对部队上训练他们的M4卡宾枪。模拟炮弹回响，小消防队通过战术无线电传达敌军活动，并指挥快速反应部队向入侵者的位置发起攻击。攻击被击退，但训练员和医务人员迅速突袭，报告有两名模拟受伤的战士。培训师监控火力下的护理和自助伙伴护理行动。飞行员被转移到安全地点后，场景在第729空中控制中队的“污垢日”第四次迭代中继续进行，这是一次48小时的训练演习。污垢，代表部署初始准备训练，在爱达荷州Mountain Home空军基地的729 ACS和726 ACS控制和报告中心教飞行员护航行动、野外生活、小武器技能、防御性场地准备、无线电通信、SABC受火、，以及其他准备技能。紧随世界各地对更机动和准备就绪的指挥和控制的新需求，俄克拉荷马州廷克空军基地552空中控制小组指挥的两个指挥控制中心，自春季以来，一直致力于标准化和培训建制专家团队。这些专家培训首次CRC部署人员，并更新更有经验的部队成员的野战技能和在远征地点操作CRC设备。多年来，他们被派往美国中央司令部和熟悉的基地，CRC部队在训练和准备部署到世界级指挥和控制所需的任何地方时，正在学习基础知识，并重新激活灵活心态。自新冠病毒出现以来，CRC干部领导创新了班级规模和时间表，允许远程学习学者、小团队培训，还有灵活的48小时实践训练。为军官和高级士官举办了一个土制Honcho领导力课程，重点是领导CRC部队和全球各地所需设备的移动，而土制骑兵课程则培训年轻军官和飞行员在远征任务中实际执行技能。“我告诉每一个班级，我们的目的是做好准备，随时应对世界范围内出现的任何突发事件。”第729届ACS的NCO主管马修・韦斯特上士说。关于网络、电磁频谱操作和小型无人机等威胁的新培训已经或将在即将到来的演习中实施。每48小时的污垢迭代都会根据真实世界和学生反馈以及其他方面的改进进行汇报和修改部队和授权基地机构。“我们需要让我们的飞行员随时准备好支持全球应急行动，”助理局长Josiah Swim少校说。“泥土学校的基本野外技能对于我们的飞行员准备部署到偏远地区的心态至关重要。”斯威姆说，每月花时间持续培训和汇报实际情况，对于提高CRC社区的灵活性和确保美国在世界级指挥和控制方面的投资，无论何时何地都是有保证的。他说：“729真是太棒了。”。“通过共同努力，战区空中控制系统的移动指挥和控制资产将为全球作战指挥官提供24小时、持久的选择。”

98,Ace lends a paw to Soldiers in need,"The New Jersey National Guard’s Psychological Health Program recently received its fifth team member, though instead of wearing combat boots, he has four paws! Ace is a rescue dog, and at eight months old, he’s been making waves throughout the state as a therapy animal in training.

Ace can be seen sporting military gear, with a large “PET ME” patch emblazoned on the side.

“He’s going to be a tool that we’re be able to use in order connect to Soldiers and provide emotional and therapeutic support throughout the state,” said Capt. Melissa Parmenter, a Behavioral Health Officer with the New Jersey Army National Guard. “Sometimes when we’re struggling with mental illness or just life stressors it’s hard to get that courage to come forward and ask for some help, so Ace’s role will be to help open that door.”

When Parmenter was trying to name the dog, her husband said that Batman had a dog named “Ace”. She immediately took to the idea, when she realized it fit the Army acronym for Ask, Care, Escort.

“A.C.E. teaches Soldiers at the lowest level, if you have a battle buddy in need, this is how to get them to the right place, and not to leave them alone until they’re in the right hands,” said Parmenter.

Ace has already been helping out Soldiers, providing comfort to those in need.

“Literally everybody’s body posture and everything changes automatically when they see him,” said Parmenter. “He’s licking everybody, and everybody is trying to touch him and hug him and get kisses from him. Like the whole demeanor of wherever he walks in changes.”

Parmenter hopes that Ace is going to break down barriers when it comes to mental health.

“I think Ace will help with a change of thinking that therapy has to be sitting at a desk and talking to someone,” said Parmenter. 

“I think it will help us get the message across that there are different modalities available and there’s different ways to receive therapy that can be helpful and really beneficial.”",2019/10/1,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/345025/ace-lends-paw-soldiers-need,"JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST, NJ, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国新泽西州MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST联合基地,王牌借给有需要的士兵一只爪子,新泽西州国民警卫队心理健康项目最近接待了第五名队员，尽管他没有穿战斗靴，而是有四只爪子！艾斯是一只救援犬，在八个月大的时候，他作为一种治疗动物在训练中在全州掀起了轩然大波。艾斯穿着军用装备，旁边装饰着一块巨大的“宠物我”贴片。新泽西州陆军国民警卫队的行为健康官员梅丽莎・帕门特上尉说：“他将成为一个工具，我们可以使用它与士兵建立联系，在全州提供情感和治疗支持。”。“有时候，当我们在与精神疾病或生活压力作斗争时，很难鼓起勇气站出来寻求帮助，所以艾斯的角色将是帮助打开那扇门。”当帕门特试图给这条狗命名时，她的丈夫说蝙蝠侠有一条狗叫“艾斯”.当她意识到这个想法与“询问、关怀、护送”的陆军首字母缩略词相符时，她立即接受了这个想法。“A.C.E.教授最底层的士兵，如果你有需要的战友，这是如何让他们到达正确的地方，在他们得到正确的控制之前不要离开他们，”埃斯已经在帮助士兵，为那些需要帮助的人提供安慰。“实际上，每个人的身体姿势和一切都会在他们看到他时自动改变，”帕门特说。“他在舔每个人，每个人都试图抚摸他，拥抱他，并得到他的亲吻。就像他走到哪里的整个举止都在改变一样。”帕门特希望Ace能够打破心理健康方面的障碍。帕门特说：“我认为Ace将有助于改变人们的观念，即治疗必须坐在桌子旁，与人交谈。我认为它将有助于我们传达这样一个信息，即有不同的治疗方式可用，有不同的治疗方式，这可能是有益的和真正有益的。”
99,ACS offers hurricane financial assistance,"Story by Michelle Cowart, Frontline Staff

The peak of hurricane season 2018 is rapidly approaching and Army Community Service will be standing by to help Soldiers and their Families prepare financially in the event a storm reaches hurricane status and impacts our area.   

If a mandatory evacuation is ordered, Soldiers and their Families may come to ACS, building 86 to request financial assistance through the Army Emergency Relief program.  

Pearson said individuals should bring an end of month leave and earning statement and power of attorney if a Family member’s Soldier is deployed.

“A specific power of attorney that states Army Emergency Relief on it.  If they do not have that, we can do an Army Regulation Form 55, but that would have to be emailed to the Soldier down range,” said Pearson.  “The Soldier will then sign it digitally and send that back but it will lengthen the process for the Family member receiving the assistance.”

ACS usually extends their hours of operation during a mandatory evacuation to accommodate Soldiers and their Families who wish to apply for financial assistance.  James Fleming, financial readiness program manager, urges those in need of financial assistance to speak to a financial counselor before they evacuate so they have money for food, gas and lodging.  

After a hurricane, ACS coordinates an Emergency Family Assistance Center, a one stop, pop-up shop consisting of financial counselors, chaplains and other support agencies to aid Soldiers and Family members with damage claims and other community needs directly resulting from the crisis.

100,Why the sky- purpose of ACE at ITX,"MARINE CORPS AIR GROUND COMBAT CENTER TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. C The Air Combat Element, known as the ACE, plays an integral role in the Marine Air Ground Task Force, as it conducts offensive, defensive and all other air operations to support the Marine Air Ground Task Force mission. Marine aviation provides the Marines of the MAGTF the operational flexibility it needs to accomplish their mission.

During Integrated Training Exercise 3-18, Marines with Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron 367, were able to help provide a variety of military operations such as collecting intelligence, sustaining combat power, providing force protection and much more.

“The purpose of our flight line is to support the infantry Marines on the ground,” said Capt. Matthew Mignoni, pilot, HMLA-367. “We will receive a mission from them, whether it be an assault support request or to provide them with close air support.”

Once the information is initially brought in, the unit’s planning takes place, briefing not only the pilots, but also the Marines that will be assisting in any facet. 

After the unit receives the information, the maintainers are briefed and get the aircrafts ready for the mission, where the pilots and their crews take to the sky providing the support necessary. 

With the Combat Center’s training area spanning more than 1,000 miles, the ACE is able to employ more than the unit’s visiting are used to.

“The big difference between training here and in Hawaii, is the array of ordinance that we can deploy here,” Mignoni said. “It is important for us, with our primary focus being close air support, because it gives the pilots and their crews the chance to integrate with ground units.”

According to Mignoni, every Marine in the Squadron has the opportunity to learn more about the MAGTF, making them prepared for the fight.",2018/5/23,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/279291/why-sky-purpose-ace-itx,"MARINE CORPS AIR GROUND COMBAT CENTER TWENTYNINE PALMS, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州二十九棕榈岛海军陆战队空地作战中心,为什么在ITX上使用ACE的目的是什么,海军陆战队空地作战中心加利福尼亚州二十九棕榈岛――被称为ACE的空战分队在海军陆战队空地特遣部队中发挥着不可或缺的作用，因为它执行进攻、防御和所有其他空中行动，以支持海军陆战队空地特遣部队的任务。海军航空为MAGTF的海军陆战队提供了完成任务所需的作战灵活性。在3-18综合训练演习中，海军陆战队与海军陆战队轻型攻击直升机中队367能够帮助提供各种军事行动，如收集情报、维持战斗力、，HMLA-367飞行员马修・米格诺尼上尉说：“我们的飞行线的目的是支持地面上的步兵陆战队。”。“我们将收到他们的任务，无论是突击支援请求还是向他们提供近距离空中支援。”一旦信息最初被输入，部队的计划就开始了，不仅向飞行员，而且向将在任何方面提供协助的海军陆战队作简报。部队收到信息后，向维修人员通报情况，让飞机做好执行任务的准备，飞行员和机组人员在那里升空，提供必要的支援。由于作战中心的训练区域跨越1000多英里，ACE能够使用的兵力超过了该部队访问时使用的兵力。“在这里训练与在夏威夷训练的最大区别在于我们可以在这里部署的兵力，”米格诺尼说。“这对我们来说很重要，我们的主要重点是近距离空中支援，因为这给了飞行员和他们的机组人员与地面部队融合的机会。”米格诺尼说，中队的每个海军陆战队都有机会了解更多关于MAGTF的信息，使他们为战斗做好准备。

Mountaineer staff

A Fort Carson civilian employee was named best in the Army in her field.

Jill Nugin, Family Advocacy Program manager, Army Community Service (ACS), Directorate of Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation, received the prestigious U.S. Army Installation Management Command Army Community Service Individual Award of Excellence during a July 20, 2017, award ceremony at the 4th Infantry Division Headquarters. 

ACS Director Patricia A. Randle nominated Nugin for the award that recognizes exemplary customer service, competence, innovation, resourcefulness and dedication to duty.

“We have the best of everything. It’s not because of what we have physically in the building, but because of our people,” said Maj. Gen. Ryan F. Gonsalves, commanding general, 4th Infantry Division and Fort Carson, who presented Nugin with the award. “It’s because of people like Jill who gives her heart and soul every day to make sure people and our commanders have every tool necessary to help people out. I just can’t thank you enough.”

Nugin heads a staff that provides several prevention programs, resources and support for the entire Fort Carson community to help reduce incidents of Family violence. Her staff also provides programs that help improve the quality of life for Soldiers and their Families, such as basic training for new mothers and fathers, cooperative parenting and divorce, resiliency training, single-parent resources and play groups. 

“It makes me feel good to be recognized for something that I feel so strongly about,” said Nugin.

These resources and programs, along with community events, are often offered during and after normal duty hours to help accommodate the constantly changing schedules of Soldiers, commanders and their Families. Nugin and her team are often found at these events organizing and leading the events and programs resulting in unusual work hours, according to Randle.

“Words can’t express how proud I am of Jill and the impact she has had on the Army community,” said Randle.",2017/7/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/260014/acs-civilian-garners-top-award,"FORT CARSON, CO, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国卡森堡,ACS平民获得最高奖项,Alexandra Sheamoundainer staffA Fort Carson文职雇员被评为该领域军队中最好的。Jill Nugin，家庭和士气、福利和娱乐董事会陆军社区服务部（ACS）家庭倡导项目经理，2017年7月20日，在第四步兵师总部举行的颁奖典礼上，获得美国陆军设施管理司令部陆军社区服务个人卓越奖。ACS主管帕特里夏A.兰德尔提名努金获得该奖项，该奖项表彰杰出的客户服务、能力、创新、足智多谋和敬业精神。“我们拥有最好的一切。这不是因为我们在大楼里拥有什么，而是因为我们的人，”总司令瑞安F.贡萨尔维斯少将说，第四步兵师和卡森堡，他们向努金颁发了这个奖项。“这是因为像吉尔这样的人，她每天全心全意地确保人民和我们的指挥官拥有一切必要的工具来帮助人民。我真是太感谢你了。”Nugin领导着一个提供多种预防方案的工作人员，为整个卡森堡社区提供资源和支持，以帮助减少家庭暴力事件。她的工作人员还提供帮助提高士兵及其家庭生活质量的方案，如为新父母提供基本培训、合作育儿和离婚、恢复力培训、单亲资源和游戏小组。努金说：“我对自己强烈感受到的东西感到很高兴，因为我得到了认可。”这些资源和项目以及社区活动通常在正常工作时间和工作时间之后提供，以帮助适应士兵、指挥官及其家人不断变化的日程安排。兰德尔说，努金和她的团队经常在这些活动中组织和领导活动和项目，导致不正常的工作时间。“言语无法表达我对吉尔以及她对军队社区的影响有多自豪，”兰德尔说。
102,726th ACS jumps into the future of communications,"Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho C The 726th Air Control Squadron received its first major Control and Reporting Center weapons system upgrade in 20 years here, May 30.


The TYQ-23A Control and Reporting Center system replaces older and bulkier 1980s style operations modules, allowing command and control operators to control a section of air space and do battle management when called upon.


“A couple of the benefits include reducing our logistical footprint where, before with the 4OM modules that weigh up to 14,000lbs, we were limited on how we can transport them out or how fast they can go,” said Lt. Col. Sean Higgins, 726th ACS commander.  “With the new system, they come as desktop computers inside of pelican cases (or short mobile cases) that can be folded up, packed and sent to the field very quickly. It also reduces the size of the support equipment and trucks that we need to get from point A to point B.”


The system has been under development for five years, contracted for four and scheduled to be delivered to the 726th for the past two years.  With Marine and other Air Force units already using similar systems, the new equipment brings the 726th to the same functionality as the others using this system. It is also familiarizes Hard Rockers with the set up that is already being used in deployed locations.


“Now I don’t spend as much time teaching my crew members how to use very specific switch actions,” said Higgins. “Basically, if they can use a mouse and a keyboard they can use the console itself.  Now they can concentrate on doing battle management versus being very specific on switch actions. They can focus on what’s important to them.”


The new weapons system isn’t the only improvement being made; additionally the 726th is training with another piece of technology that can make operations more efficient.  The small communications package is an inflatable satellite that was developed in support of special operations, giving them the mobile capability to be used by small teams while still being able to be used for long periods of time.


“The GATR (Ground Antenna Transmit and Receive) ball system we have is a 2.4 meter dish. What it does is it takes the place of our small aperture antenna, which is also a 2.4 meter dish but this one makes it a lot simpler,” said Senior Airman Jeffrey Shields, radio frequency transmissions systems technician. “We get the same type of receiving power, but with this system we can go from the case to the satellite in 36 minutes because the inflation system makes it a lot quicker compared to the small aperture antenna, which takes from four to six hours.”

As the first ACS that is getting access to test the small communications package, the 726th will be testing it throughout the summer and later in the year for the Gunfighter Flag exercise. 


“This particular small communications package gives us the capability of having that long haul ability without using combat communications,” said Higgins. “What we’re seeing so far is that it is probably going to work for us. So now we’re less reliant on other agencies and can do most of the job ourselves.”",2017/6/6,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/236580/726th-acs-jumps-into-future-communications,"MOUNTAIN HOME AIR FORCE BASE, ID, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国印第安纳州山地家园空军基地,726 ACS跃入通信的未来,爱达荷州山之家空军基地――726空中控制中队于5月30日在这里接受了20年来首次重大控制和报告中心武器系统升级。TYQ-23A控制和报告中心系统取代了旧的、笨重的1980年代风格的作战模块，允许指挥和控制操作员控制一部分空域，并在需要时进行作战管理。“其中的几个好处包括减少我们的后勤足迹，在使用重量高达14000磅的4OM模块之前，我们限制了如何将其运出或其速度。”ACS第726指挥官肖恩・希金斯中校说。“有了新系统，它们就像装在鹈鹕皮箱（或短手机皮箱）里的台式电脑，可以很快折叠、打包并送往战场。它还减少了从A点到B点所需的支持设备和卡车的体积。”该系统已经开发了五年，合同期为四年，计划在过去两年内交付至726。由于海军陆战队和其他空军部队已经在使用类似的系统，新装备使726与其他使用该系统的部队具有相同的功能。希金斯说：“现在我没有花那么多时间教我的机组成员如何使用非常具体的开关动作。”。“基本上，如果他们可以使用鼠标和键盘，他们就可以使用控制台本身。现在他们可以集中精力进行战斗管理，而不是非常具体地进行切换动作。他们可以专注于对他们来说重要的事情。”新的武器系统并不是唯一的改进；此外，第726架飞机正在使用另一项技术进行训练，这项技术可以提高作战效率。小型通信包是一种充气卫星，是为支持特种作战而开发的，使其具有移动能力，可供小型团队使用，同时仍能长期使用。”我们的球形系统是一个2.4米长的碟形天线。它所做的是取代我们的小口径天线，这也是一个2.4米长的碟形天线，但这一个使它简单得多，”无线电频率传输系统技术员杰弗里・希尔兹（Jeffrey Shields）说。“我们获得了相同类型的接收功率，但使用该系统，我们可以在36分钟内从机箱传送到卫星，因为充气系统比小口径天线快得多，小口径天线需要4到6个小时。”作为第一个进入测试小型通信包的ACS，第726战斗机将在整个夏季和今年晚些时候进行测试，以进行武装斗士旗帜演习。希金斯说：“这种特殊的小型通信设备使我们能够在不使用战斗通信的情况下实现远距离通信。”。“到目前为止，我们所看到的是，它可能会为我们工作。因此，现在我们不再那么依赖其他机构，可以自己完成大部分工作。”
103,Aviation assault- Aces repel and repair,"Marines with Marine Wing Support Squadron (MWSS) 373 conducted a base recovery after attack training (BRAAT) evolution during Integrated Training Exercise (ITX) 3-17 at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center Twentynine Palms, California, May 23. 

The BRAAT exercise allowed MWSS-373 to experience an attack on a strategic expeditionary landing field (SELF), requiring them to take defensive action and repair any equipment or runway space which may have been damaged.

“We have a simulated airfield attack taking place today at the airfield,” said 1st Lt. Trevor Isbell, MWSS-373 support company executive officer. “We have positioned Marines to defend against the attacks and have units standing by to assess the repair work when we are given the clear.”

At the start of the attack, Marines with MWSS-373 manned defensive watch positions, mounted light machine guns on tactical vehicles and returned fire.

“Our job was to provide security for the wing and defend the airfield from simulated hostiles,” said Lance Cpl. Taijonathan Collins, an MWSS-373 water support technician. “The primary focus for the guards in the watchtowers is logging the enemy positions and calling them into headquarters so the armored vehicles could provide defensive fire.”

Following the counter-attack, Marines assessed the damage and worked to return the SELF to an operational status.

“Once the attack ceased, headquarters gave the order and accountability was taken,” commented Isbell. “At that point, we transitioned from the defensive portion, to the base recovery. During the base recovery, teams assess assigned sectors for damage then relay that information back to headquarters.”

“We survey the area on foot and in vehicles so we don’t miss any portion of the flight line,” said Collins. “You play how you practice and if we practice hard, we are going to do it right when it comes game time.”

ITX 3-17 is primarily focused on direct Marine air-ground task force (MAGTF) integration. The BRAAT exercise gave MWSS-373 the opportunity to bring together the ground combat element (GCE) and the ACE, allowing both elements to operate effectively.

“The ACE and the GCE are vital to this exercise,” said Isbell. “The ACE helps with specific repair work to get birds in the air for a counter-attack and the GCE aids as a quick reaction force that can be called if the threat was large enough. They both play key roles in MAGTF integration at ITX 3-17.”

104,Airman attains rare ACE award,"Perfection is often pursued, but rarely obtained. Dedication, sacrifice and self-discipline become the constant companions of those seeking such lofty heights.

Such is the case for U.S. Air Force Reserve Staff Sgt. Jason Britten, a resident of Springdale, Arkansas and an aerospace ground equipment apprentice assigned to the 913th Maintenance Squadron, 913th Airlift Group, Little Rock Air Force Base, Arkansas. Britten received the prestigious ACE Award March 20, 2017 while training at Sheppard AFB, Texas.  

“The ACE award is the highest academic honor a student can receive and is earned for exceptional performance by maintaining a perfect 100 percent through an entire course,” said Chief Master Sgt. Scott Goetze, the Air Force Reserve Command Training Liaison and Superintendent at Sheppard AFB. “To give you an idea of the difficulty involved, there have only been four others in ten years who have achieved such academic excellence. He was the only Reservist in his class and left a lasting positive impression on the other Airmen and the school staff.”

Britten’s class consisted of 12 students who spent 95 academic training days in the Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE) Apprentice Course. During that time, 14 exams in 15 blocks of instruction were administered. All exams were computer based, while hands-on-training and testing were done in the classroom.

“My goal was to do the very best that I could,” said Britten, who had never heard of the ACE Award until the class started. “Mechanics has always been a passion and I wanted to excel.”

Excelling required Britten to dedicate his time to constant study.  

“The secret to my success was studying,” said Britten. “I would study every night and review class notes and homework for sections I wasn't confident in.” 

However, his time wasn’t always his own. As the ranking class member and class leader, Britten often sacrificed his personal study time to help others succeed.

“Being the class leader requires additional time to mentor and provide advice to the other classmates,” said Goetze. “In so many situations involving pipeline students, they often need simple life and career advice that our more mature Reservists, such as Staff. Sgt. Britten, are well postured to provide.”

Britten admits that he started to feel pressure building as he aced each exam, but he used it to narrow his focus. Additionally, he knew he had the encouragement of his peers. 

“After every test, my classmates would ask what my score was. They were all very supportive of my efforts,” Britten said. 

Even had he missed a few points here and there, Britten said he would have maintained the self-discipline to stick with his goal to excel.  

“No matter where you’re at, you should always do your best to succeed and strive for perfection,” said Britten. “If you do your best, even if you stumble, you won't be far from the top.”

Britten, now back at his unit, plans on continuing to mentor others and perfect his craft.

105,ACS offers leadership workshop for spouses,"Army Community Service at Joint Base Langley-Eustis hosted a Junior Leader Spouse Workshop for spouses of junior enlisted service members to discuss military traditions, provide mentoring and information about Family Readiness Groups, March 22, 2017. 

The spouses gather bimonthly for these workshops to determine their leadership opportunities alongside their service member as they move up in the ranks. Some of the topics covered during the workshops include support channels, expectations and protocol.

“We have senior spouses as facilitators for the workshop, which allows participants to hear from people who have ‘walked the walk’ and can share their experiences,” said Donna Cloy, 733rd Mission Support Group Army Family Team building program manager. “The workshop is an informal setting where spouses can get some basic information, but more importantly they can ask questions from people who have lived this life already.”

According to Cloy, building relationships, support channels and networking is a major reason they host the workshop. By providing junior spouses with a mentor, they can receive guidance regarding their new environment, which can make a difference in adjusting to military lifestyle. 

Through the workshop, military spouses discover ways to make a difference with new leadership skills. These skills also show them how to get involved in their service member’s unit, such as helping plan events or fundraisers for the units.  

“Service members get a lot of training before they are placed in leadership roles, so why would we expect spouses to take on roles without giving them training as well,” asked Cloy. “We are hoping to give spouses the skills that will make it easy for them to decide to be involved in the unit and to feel prepared when they take on these roles.”

Tommisha Wilson, wife of U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Tillman Wilson Jr., Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion, 128th Aviation Brigade instructor, attended her first workshop when she arrived to JBLE in 2014, she has since been inspired to teach resiliency and coping mechanisms to spouses at ACS. 

After taking every course available for spouses at the ACS, Wilson began volunteering her time to get new spouses involved in the programs. Wilson’s passion for the training encouraged her to complete two internships with ACS while in school for her Bachelor of Science in Child and Human Services. Now working on her Master of Arts in Human Services, Wilson continues to advocate for the skills and networking ACS has to offer.  

“The training at ACS empowers spouses to know what is going on with our service members,” said Wilson. “It made me want to share the knowledge I gained with other spouses and I just kept wanting to learn more so I could give back more.” 

Wilson used the courses as a stepping stone toward ensuing a fulfilling profession and continues to work to make a difference as a Master Resilience Trainer for the ACS. 

With classes ranging from communication time and stress management, to personal relationship and team dynamics, Wilson encourages spouses to take advantage of the courses ACS has to offer.

106,ACES Club spreads Holiday Cheer,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. C Sixteen Airmen from the 908th Airlift Wing’s Airmen Committed to Excellence Club visited the Montgomery Children’s Specialty Clinic December 4, 2016 to spread holiday cheer to the 52 patients at the clinic.

The club started the visit playing board games and reading books to a small group of children.

Senior Airman Ulysses Petty, member of the 25th Aerial Port Squadron and President of the 908th ACES Club said, “We are a part of this community so we want to show our support of the community.”

To be a part of the community means getting involved and doing what is right.

“Reaching out makes us approachable,” said Petty. “They recognize us and know why we are here, they remember us and that makes a good impact.”

After having fun in the recreation room, a portion of the club went room to room hand delivering holiday cards to the kids.

“I really like interacting with the kids and seeing their rooms,” said Senior Airman Elicia Walker, member of the 25th APS and the ACES Club Vice President.

The ACES Club is able to see the larger picture, making outreach a privilege instead of a chore.

“Stuff like this gets us involved in the community,” said Walker. “It’s not only a good thing for the kids it’s a huge morale boost for us as well.”

Sometimes community outreach events can take months to plan and put together but according to Walker, “this only took us one [Unit Training Assembly] to get everything set.”

Senior leaders in the 908th are extremely proud of the work being done by the club.

“It’s exciting to be around these Airmen and to be a part of this,” said Chief Master Sgt. Brent Solomon, Flight Engineer Superintendent of the 357th Airlift Squadron and a mentor to the 908th AW ACES Club.

Solomon is in place to be a mentor for the group but feels as though sometimes he is just along for the ride.

“I’m here as a mentor but they don’t need it,” said Solomon. “People call this group our future leaders, but with the drive and commitment they have, this group is already leading.”

The club with continue their community outreach efforts with canned food drives, events for the veterans home and for the homeless in the area.

“This club lets the community know that they are going to have great group of young leaders around for years to come,” said Solomon",2016/12/4,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/222942/aces-club-spreads-holiday-cheer,"MAXWELL AIR FORCE BASE, AL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国阿尔卑斯州麦克斯韦空军基地,王牌俱乐部为节日欢呼,阿拉巴马州蒙哥马利市――12月4日，来自第908空运联队致力于卓越俱乐部的16名飞行员参观了蒙哥马利儿童专科诊所，2016年，向诊所的52名患者传播节日欢乐。俱乐部开始为一小群儿童玩棋盘游戏和读书。第25航空港中队成员、第908 ACES俱乐部主席、高级飞行员尤利西斯・佩蒂说，佩蒂说：“我们是这个社区的一部分，所以我们想表示我们对社区的支持。成为社区的一部分意味着参与进来，做正确的事情。接触让我们变得平易近人。他们认识我们，知道我们为什么在这里，他们记得我们，这会产生良好的影响。”在娱乐室玩得很开心之后，俱乐部的一部分成员挨家挨户地亲手给孩子们发节日贺卡。“我真的很喜欢和孩子们互动，看看他们的房间。”高级飞行员Elicia Walker说，她是第25 APS的成员，也是ACES俱乐部的副主席。ACES俱乐部能够看到更大的图景，使外展成为一种特权，而不是一件琐事。“这样的事情让我们参与到社区中来，”Walker说。“这不仅对孩子们是一件好事，对我们的士气也是一个巨大的鼓舞。”有时社区外联活动可能需要几个月的时间来计划和组织，但沃克说，“我们只花了一次[部队训练大会]就把一切都准备好了。”908的高级领导人对俱乐部所做的工作感到非常自豪。“与这些飞行员在一起并成为其中的一员，这很令人兴奋。”357空运中队的飞行工程师总监兼908 AW ACES俱乐部的导师布伦特・所罗门上士（Brent Solomon）上士说。所罗门是该组织的导师，但有时他觉得自己只是在搭便车。所罗门说：“我在这里是导师，但他们不需要。”。“人们称这个团体为我们未来的领导者，但凭借他们的努力和承诺，这个团体已经处于领先地位。”俱乐部继续其社区外联活动，为退伍军人之家和该地区的无家可归者举办活动。所罗门说：“这个俱乐部让社区知道，在未来的几年里，他们将有一群伟大的年轻领袖。”
107,SecFor Marines Ace target practice,"Marines with Security Forces Company, Marine Wing Support Squadron-373, decimated the wooden targets as part of a live-fire and maneuver range while forward deployed in the Central Command area of responsibility, July 18, 2016. The range involved buddy-rushing maneuvers between points and multiple static target engagements.

“Our mission is to have a well-disciplined security force and to have flawless air-ground support; to be able to respond to any situation very quickly and efficiently,” said Cpl. Christopher Truax, a team leader with 3rd platoon. The company’s mission is to ensure the safety and security of the base to which they are assigned. 

“This training would come into play in two scenarios: the first being an active shooter within the base and the second being a direct fire threat from outside the base perimeter,” said 1st Lt. Robert Winter, the platoon commander, of Fairfield, Calif. 

“This type of training is important to keep the Marines proficient, to make sure we know how our weapon systems are operating,” he added. “It’s also important for the leadership so we know where we are deficient and what we need to work on.”

The company is made up of Marines from a variety of backgrounds outside of Marine Corps infantry. The range, and the advanced shooting skills reviewed, better prepare them to reacting to a myriad of possible security threats. Truax, a food service specialist by trade, added another important aspect of the training was how his team displayed the skills as a whole.

 “We get to see where we’re at as a fire team,” said Truax, of Horseheads, N.Y. “We also get to communicate well; focus on the sounds of each other and how each member moves.” The course of fire requires teams of Marines to engage multiple targets as they make their approach, the intent being to prepare the security forces for any threat they may face.

108,Ace in the Hole- Iron Blitz 2016,"MARINE CORPS BASE CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. C The sound of M1A1 Abrams tanks resonated throughout the base, announcing their presence as the Marines with 2nd Tank Battalion, 2nd Marine Division conducted Marine Corps Combat Readiness Evaluation, “Iron Blitz,” Feb. 19-26, 2016.

The MCCRE consisted of multiple scenarios, including a tactical road march, breaching and clearing a mock village, traversing the New River with the aid of bridges from 8th Engineer Support Battalion and landing craft utilities from the Navy, and a tank platoon gunnery range for qualification. 

This training helped instill the battalion’s mission to close with and destroy the enemy using armor-protected firepower, shock effect, maneuver, and to provide precision direct fires against enemy armor, fighting vehicles, troops and hardened positions.

Iron Blitz involved a vast array of units from across the division: Reconnaissance, infantry, engineering and artillery units joined 2nd Tank Bn. in the exercise.

“The ability to conduct this training with all these other units is great,” said Lt. Col. Robert Bodisch, commanding officer of 2nd Tank Bn., 2nd Marine Division. “Having lost two tank companies recently has really put some pressure on us, but it feels good knowing that we can still accomplish our mission while doing more with less.” 

The units became more comfortable with working alongside one another during the course of the exercise, and each Marine, from the individual level to the battalion level, played their respective parts well to accomplish the mission in the most coordinated way possible, Bodisch said.

“2nd Tank Battalion is 2nd Marine Division’s ace in the hole because we are a unique battalion within the division,” said Capt. Matthew Rohlfing, operations officer for 2nd Tank Battalion. “There is something a tank brings to the battlefield that can’t be replicated by any other ground combat element. We are the big guns and we are here to stay.”

109,"ACE provides Airmen a voice, opportunity","NELLIS AIR FORCE BASE, Nev. C Hidden deep down, in the innards of a human body there’s a voice that wants to be heard. More often than not, that voice is hidden so deep its kicking and screaming cannot be heard because of a fear of standing out from the crowd.

For many junior enlisted Airmen, Nellis Air Force Base can be an intimidating and stressful duty station - especially if they feel like their voice isn’t being heard. One organization is dedicated to ensuring the lowest ranking Airmen on base have an opportunity to be heard, while helping them develop their leadership skills and giving them a chance to interact with people of similar rank. 

“Airman Committed to Excellence is a nonprofit, private organization that is dedicated to improving the career development of Airmen on Nellis AFB,” said Airman 1st Class Reuben Perry, ACE president and 99th Medical Support Squadron information technology technician. 

The ACE council provides Airmen a forum to voice problems, suggestions and quality of life issues. During their monthly forums, the ACE council provides input and feedback from their units to command chiefs and first sergeants, who regularly attend the meetings. 

“I would say that Airmen definitely have a voice through ACE,” said Perry. “ACE has a first shirt liaison, senior NCO liaison, and a chief liaison that are open to listen to concerns and opinions from the Airmen. I also have connections with dorm management, the dorm council, and I meet up with Chief Cleveland, the 99th Air Base Wing, command chief, once a month so I can also bring up any concerns and/or opinions from the Airmen as well. ”

ACE not only helps Airmen enhance career development, but also hosts morale events, volunteer opportunities, and fundraising projects.

“All ranks are welcome to participate in ACE,” said Senior Airman Chelsey Pennington, ACE vice president and 99th MDSS unit deployment manager. “However, only E-1 through E-4 are eligible to participate in all of the morale events, as well as, run as an executive officer.” 

The ACE council has hosted many successful events in the past, such as skydiving, kayaking, mountain biking, rock climbing, paintball and much more.

“With the events the ACE council offers, my favorite thing is meeting new Airmen, “said Pennington. “The council provides Airmen with the opportunity to stand out among their peers, network outside of organizations, free food and a chance to increase morale. ”

110,ACS financial- Virtual format complements mission,"By Scott Prater

Mountaineer staff

FORT CARSON, Colo. ― Since the Army introduced its people-first priority earlier this year, installations have embarked on a variety of efforts to improve Soldiers’ well-being. At the Mountain Post, Maj. Gen. Matthew W. McFarlane, commanding general, 4th Infantry Division and Fort Carson, directed post leaders to create foundational readiness programs for Soldiers ― programs designed to help Soldiers focus on spiritual, physical, relationship and financial wellness.

Fort Carson’s Army Community Service (ACS) has played a vital role in this initiative, as its staff have either created or enhanced programs to support the effort. 

In February 2021, Silke Bone, personal financial counselor, ACS, began teaching some of ACS’s financial readiness classes both in person and virtually. The information relayed during these classes is something ACS staff typically cover in one-on-one sessions with Soldiers, Families and government civilians, but the recent foundational readiness initiative has provided an opportunity for the staff to convey their knowledge to a larger audience. 

If there has been one positive outcome from recent pandemic prevention measures, it’s that they’ve prompted organizations to offer virtual services. 

Bone conducts virtual financial foundational readiness classes every Friday. Attendees simply sign up for a class through ACS and Bone sends them a link to join a class prior to its start time.

“We can also use a variety of video conferencing platforms,” she said. “Attendees can request that we use a platform they are familiar with. I’ve conducted classes via Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Webex. Really, the chosen platform depends on the size of a class. I’ve had classes with as little as six attendees and some over 100, but our average is around 12.”

When deciding the types of classes offered virtually, Bone and Scott Brown, personal financial readiness specialist, ACS, searched through the ACS course catalog and chose those topics that might benefit the largest number of service members. Ultimately, they chose four classes ― Developing a Spending Plan, Saving and Investing, Thrift Savings Plan and Stretching Your Money.

“We want to try to reach service members when they reach life events in the military,” Brown said. “For instance, when they reach their first duty station, when they get married, (permanent change of station), have their first baby, buy a home and so on. That way, Soldiers and Families can get the best resources and education in those times they may need them most.”

As pandemic restrictions have eased somewhat recently, ACS staff started offering limited in-person financial readiness classes, as well.

“I just taught a class at Prussman Chapel for a unit, and I’ll augment the family life center’s program taught by the chaplains soon,” Brown said.

Bone prefers to meet people in person because she can demonstrate with different techniques, she said, but the virtual classes are here to stay. At least for the time being. 

“During the height of the pandemic, I was teaching virtually only,” she said. “It simply works better for some people ― for a spouse with small children, for example, who would have to load the Family into the car and make a trip down to our offices, or for a deployed Soldier. It’s nice to have that virtual option.”

While April is Financial Literacy Awareness Month, Brown said it provides a good time for ACS staff to reach people and relay the importance of being proactive about their finances. 

“We’re also here for unit leaders who want to be reactive to Soldiers who get into trouble with their finances,” he said.

111,729th ACS participates in Agile Thunder exercise,"HILL AIR FORCE BASE, Utah -- Validating its ability to deploy on a moment’s notice anywhere in the world and demonstrate air battle management command and control capabilities, the 729th Air Control Squadron recently participated in a mobility exercise called Agile Thunder.

“This exercise, and others like it, force us to prove that we are able to respond to unsure conditions and answer the kinds of problems we would face in the field,” said Capt. Eric Dayhuff, 729th ACS mission systems flight commander.    

The exercise was broken into two phases. During phase one, the squadron tested its equipment, then packed and moved it. In the second phase, they built a site and provided command and control for aircraft sorties.

The first phase also tested the installation’s 75th Logistics Readiness Squadron ability to pack and ship equipment. The 75th LRS serves as the “deployment machine” for all of Hill Air Force Base, said Maj. Jon Arceta, 75th LRS commander.

“For this exercise, the goal was to deploy our 729th ACS partners, personnel and cargo as efficient and expeditious as we could, in order to meet the combatant commander’s needs downrange,” Arceta said.

The squadron was inspected on unit mobility procedures, individual deployment readiness and the ability to survive and operate skills in a deployed environment.

“More than just working on our equipment, we are expected to employ it in realistic field conditions in order to make the mission happen,” Dayhuff said. “These types of exercises help highlight where we are strong and where we can improve in the future.”

The 729th ACS is a geographically separated unit of the 552nd Air Control Wing at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. The squadron is one of three active-duty air control squadrons in the Air Force and has approximately 400 personnel assigned to the squadron.

Dayhuff said the biggest challenge to any exercise involving hundreds of people and dozens of equipment items is communication.

“This exercise highlighted the flexibility and preserving spirit of our team,” he said. “Despite facing a myriad of challenges, both expected and unexpected, the team found a way to pull together and ultimately meet our critical objectives and build our competency across the board.”",2021/4/12,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/393766/729th-acs-participates-agile-thunder-exercise,"HILL AIR FORCE BASE, UT, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国犹他州希尔空军基地,729 ACS参加敏捷雷电演习,犹他州希尔空军基地――729空中控制中队最近参加了一次称为“敏捷雷霆”的机动演习，以验证其在世界任何地方随时部署的能力，并展示其空战管理指挥和控制能力。“这项练习，以及其他类似的练习，迫使我们证明我们能够应对不确定的条件，并回答我们在该领域将面临的各种问题。”ACS 729任务系统飞行指挥官Eric Dayhuff上尉说。演习分为两个阶段。在第一阶段，中队测试了设备，然后打包和移动。在第二阶段，他们建造了一个场地，为飞机架次提供指挥和控制。第一阶段还测试了该设施的第75次后勤保障第75 LRS指挥官Jon Arceta少校说，第75 LRS作为希尔空军基地的“部署机器”。“这次演习的目标是尽可能高效、快速地部署我们的729 ACS合作伙伴、人员和货物，以满足作战指挥官在低空的需求。”该中队在部队机动程序、个人部署准备情况以及在部署环境中生存和操作技能等方面接受了检查。“不仅仅是在我们的设备上工作，我们还希望在现实的野外条件下使用它，以便完成任务，”Dayhuff说。“这些类型的练习有助于突出我们的强项和未来可以改进的地方。”729 ACS是位于俄克拉荷马州廷克空军基地的552空中控制联队的一个地理上分离的部队。该中队是美国空军三个现役空中控制中队之一，约有400名人员被分配到该中队。Dayhuff说，这是涉及数百人和数十人的任何演习中最大的挑战设备项目是沟通。他说：“这项活动突出了我们团队的灵活性和保持精神。尽管面临着无数的挑战，包括预期的和意外的挑战，但团队找到了一种方法，齐心协力，最终实现我们的关键目标，全面提升我们的能力。”
112,ACS training expands to meet units’ needs,"By Scott Prater

Mountaineer staff

FORT CARSON, Colo. ― Fort Carson’s Army Community Service (ACS) rolled out a new training program for individual company representatives recently and the program signifies a major change to the way the organization supports military units.

After Army leaders decided to reorganize traditional Family Readiness Groups from spouse-driven organizations to those led by military commanders back in April 2020, they took another step in November when they ordered Army divisions to designate Family readiness representatives at the company level.

Previously, readiness representatives were known as Family Readiness Liaisons. Now, they are known as Command Family Readiness Representatives (CFRR). 

The conversion is much more significant than a simple name change, said Connie Roy, Family enrichment program manager at Fort Carson’s ACS.
“Previously, we had readiness liaisons at the battalion level, whereas now, every company has a CFRR,” Roy explained. “And the CFRRs have a much more expansive scope than their predecessors.”

With that expansive scope comes more in-depth training ― training that’s provided by ACS staff. 

“We went from holding a course quarterly with 10 attendees to now we’re holding courses every two weeks with 50 or 60 attendees,” Roy said. “So were getting all of the company-level CFRR trained up on everything from Soldier and Family readiness topics to the availability of resources. 
Roy now has four ACS staff members to assist in developing and delivering course curriculum, something that’s also changed along with the new Army operational order.

“Really, the CFRR is charged with managing the Soldier and Family Readiness Group (SFRG) so Soldiers and Families have a liaison right there in the company who can help them understand what resources exist and someone who can also make referrals for them, kind of do a warm hand off and really plug them into services.”

The ACS training, Roy said, informs CFRRs about their roles and responsibilities, how they can build communication within their groups, how to manage the SRFG’s informal fund, recruiting volunteers and managing casualty response teams. The course also covers social media operational security (OPSEC), Family advocacy and other resources. Of course, in the current pandemic environment, these courses must be conducted virtually, which adds complexity and planning requirements simply because of the sheer number of attendees. 

Each battalion and brigade also has a CFRR to manage the program at a higher level, and they all fall under Capt. Brian Hicks, Soldier and Family Readiness Program coordinator, 4th Infantry Division.

“This has been a point of emphasis for the commanding general,” Hicks said. “He wants to have strong SFRGs, as it’s consistent with the Army’s ‘People First’ initiative. “I think it’s a good thing because it helps communication. We now have two individuals (the CFRR and an assigned assistant) at the lowest unit level and that allows the brigade representatives to have greater fidelity and communication. Yes, every representative is going to be unique, but it’s a way for us to share information and push guidance so that everyone can get on the same page.”

Roy said ACS staff are continually updating the CFRR training course based on lessons learned from previous versions, and that unit representatives can and do continually seek clarification, guidance and information from ACS as they perform their CFRR roles.",2021/1/14,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/391492/acs-training-expands-meet-units-needs,UNITED STATES,[],[],美国,ACS培训扩展以满足部队需求,作者：科罗拉多州斯科特・普拉特蒙特・斯塔夫堡・卡森-卡森堡陆军社区服务中心（ACS）最近推出了一项针对个别连队代表的新培训计划，该计划标志着该组织支持军事单位的方式发生了重大变化。陆军领导人决定在2020年4月将传统的家庭准备小组从配偶驱动的组织改组为由军事指挥官领导的组织后，他们在11月采取了另一个步骤，命令陆军师在连一级指定家庭准备就绪代表。以前，准备就绪代表被称为家庭准备就绪联络员。现在，他们被称为司令部家庭准备就绪代表（CFRR）。卡森堡ACS的家庭充实项目经理康妮・罗伊（Connie Roy）说，这种转变比简单的改名意义重大得多。“以前，我们在营一级有战备联络，而现在，每个连都有一个CFRR，”罗伊解释道。“CFRRs比他们的前任有更广阔的范围。”随着范围的扩大，ACS员工提供了更深入的培训。罗伊说：“我们从每季度举办一次10人的课程，到现在每两周举办一次50或60人的课程。”。“因此，我们让所有连队级CFRR都接受了从士兵和家庭准备话题到资源可用性等方面的培训。罗伊现在有四名ACS员工协助开发和提供课程课程，这一点也随着新的陆军作战命令而改变。“实际上，CFRR负责管理士兵和家庭准备小组（SFRG），因此士兵和家庭在连队中有一个联络人，可以帮助他们了解存在哪些资源，也可以为他们提供推荐，有点热情地帮助他们，让他们真正投入服务。”Roy说，ACS培训向CFRR告知他们的角色和责任，他们如何在小组内建立沟通，如何管理SRFG的非正式基金，招募志愿者和管理伤亡响应团队。课程还包括社交媒体运营安全（OPSEC），家庭倡导和其他资源。当然，在当前的大流行环境中，这些课程必须以虚拟方式进行，这增加了复杂性和规划要求，仅仅是因为参与者的数量太多。每个营和旅也有一个CFRR来管理更高级别的项目，他们都属于Brian Hi上尉第四步兵师士兵和家庭准备项目协调员cks说：“这一直是指挥官的重点。他希望拥有强大的SFRG，因为这符合陆军的“以人为本”计划。“我认为这是一件好事，因为它有助于沟通。我们现在有两个人（CFRR和一名指定助理）是的，每个代表都是独一无二的，但这是我们分享信息和推动指导的一种方式，这样每个人都能站在同一个页面上。”Roy说，ACS员工正在根据从以前版本中吸取的经验教训不断更新CFRR培训课程，各单位代表在履行CFRR职责时，可以也确实会不断向ACS寻求澄清、指导和信息。
113,19th AW continues to advance ACE integration,"The 61st Airlift Squadron concluded a weeklong, organically generated exercise, Feb. 20, demonstrating the effectiveness of Agile Combat Employment (ACE) tactics, techniques and procedures focused on Mobility Air Force and Combat Air Force integration. 

The off-station training, dubbed the Catalina Weapons Mixer, sought to integrate operations between three C-130J Super Hercules and six A-10 Thunderbolt IIs assigned to the 354th Fighter Squadron, from Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona. 

Spanning three states, seven military installations, and units from Air Mobility Command, Air Combat Command, the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, the joint exercise validated the ability of a small package of C-130Js to operate effectively in support of multiple joint users with little to no overhead.

Capt. Trevor Cutler, 61st AS pilot and one of the lead planners for the exercise, said one of the overarching objectives of the Catalina Weapons Mixer was to move past simulating ACE tactics, and instead use the exercise as a venue for real-world experimentation and evaluation. 

“The biggest goal of the OST was to plan and execute TTPs in line with the 2018 National Defense Strategy and to answer our Chief of Staff’s charge to accelerate change,” he said. “As a result, the OST fell into two general lines of effort: refining ACE tactics, techniques, and procedures and executing core Herk competencies in unfamiliar ways.”

As units across the Air Force continue to develop and refine what ACE looks like for their particular mission-set, the 19th Airlift Wing has aggressively pursued operational experimentation to inform emerging concepts of employment, and where the C-130 platform fits within this larger Air Force picture.

“In order to reduce the Air Force’s dependence on large overseas bases, we need to present decision-makers with credible capabilities, and the entire force must become more nimble,” Cutler said. “The C-130J is perfectly positioned geographically, technically and culturally to help lead the force in this transition.”

Of note, refueling operations under the ACE construct was a core tactic the OST sought to further evaluate.

During this exercise, a C-130J wet-wing defueled 24,000 pounds of fuel into an R-11 truck which then refueled two A-10s on the ramp at a Strategic Expeditionary Landing Field (SELF), marking the first time an AMC aircraft conducted actual fueling support of CAF via this TTP.

“This is something that has been discussed as a hypothetical capability, but to our knowledge hadn’t actually been done before,” said Capt. Alexander Humphrey, 61st AS pilot and lead planner for the exercise. “Conducting the fuel transfer highlighted some limitations of the capability, and identified the fine tuning we will need to execute this in an operational environment.”

According to Cutler, utilizing this training venue to enhance familiarity and integration of MAF and CAF assets was also a principal objective of the OST.

This included a mission of flying two C-130Js and two A-10s along a low-level route to a simulated emergency Low-Cost, Low-Altitude drop, honing air escort skills for both units.

“In the C-130J, we are very good at what we do while deployed and at retaining the ability to support the Army in mass airdrops or airland movements,” Cutler said. “But if we are to remain flexible and resilient in future conflicts, we need be able to work with every imaginable user in the Air Force.

“We need to train to what’s unfamiliar in an efficient way to push the boundaries of our comfort zone and learn lessons that are applicable in a wide range of scenarios,” he added.

Primarily basing operations out of Naval Air Station North Island, California, the support provided by the 61st AS to the 354th FS enabled the A-10s to also participate in Winter Fury ‘21, a U.S. Marine Corps exercise at the Marine Corps Air Ground Center at Twentynine Palms, California. 

Moreover, the C-130Js provided agile combat airlift throughout the USMC exercise, positioning, de-positioning, and conducting training with the 5/11 Marines out of Camp Pendleton, California, executing two lifts of High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) for simulated fires.

“Marines do business differently than soldiers or Airmen, and learning how to plan directly with CAF users without a central planning agency like TACC [Tanker Airlift Control Center] or an AMD [Air Mobility Division] is really valuable,” Cutler said. “Time and resources are finite in the military and across the government, so we need to be able to integrate effectively with users across the joint force and with a warrior’s mindset.”

In order for ACE to work, the service must rethink the way it operates. 

Traditionally, Airmen have a single Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) and perform only those tasks and functions defined by that AFSC. With ACE, however, Airmen must be ready and able to perform other tasks as well. 
This means small teams of Airmen must become “multi-capable,” which demands flexibility and change. 

In total, the OST brought together 25 personnel, across a myriad of AFSCs within the 19th Airlift Wing, to assess the Multi-Capable Airmen concept.

“The team we brought from Little Rock was able to identify creative solutions to problems we faced in the field,” said Cutler. “By the end of the exercise, we had loadmasters engaging with maintenance to load plan without an MPC [Mission Planning Cell] or AMD. We had USMC personnel support Little Rock LRS [Logistics Readiness Squadron] in ensuring the R-11 fuel truck we brought with us was air-worthy to fly home.” 

Cutler added that many jobs within the Air Force are “siloed,” meaning that the service by-in-large needs to better grasp the responsibilities or aims of the different specialties. 

“We need to develop a greater degree of awareness if we are to become the Multi-Capable Airmen the CSAF and AMC commander have talked about,” he said. “Our training sought to embrace that ethos, and even when we faced difficulties, we learned an incredible amount both personally and institutionally.”

What this particular OST proved was that the C-130J provides significant operational capabilities that translate directly into increased combat effectiveness. 

“C-130Js are one of only a handful of aircraft across the Department of Defense that are solely dedicated to the tactical airlift mission,” said Humphrey. “Stepping away from our traditional role of supporting the Army to more deeply integrate with the CAF and USMC demonstrates how flexible our community is in terms of both what we can do and who we can integrate with as fellow joint warfighters.”",2021/2/25,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/389961/19th-aw-continues-advance-ace-integration,"LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE, AR, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国阿肯色州小石城空军基地,19 AW继续推进ACE整合,2月20日，第61空运中队结束了为期一周的有机生成演习，展示了以机动空军和作战空军一体化为重点的敏捷作战使用（ACE）战术、技术和程序的有效性。这项被称为“卡塔琳娜武器混合器”的站外训练旨在整合三架C-130J超级大力士和六架A-10霹雳II型战机之间的作战，这些战机是从亚利桑那州的戴维斯-蒙坦空军基地分配给第354战斗机中队的。此次联合演习涵盖三个州、七个军事设施以及来自空中机动司令部、空战司令部、美国海军和美国海军陆战队的部队，验证了一小批C-130Js能够在几乎没有开销的情况下有效地支持多个联合用户。61岁的特雷弗・卡特勒（Trevor Cutler）是这次演习的飞行员和主要策划人之一。他说，卡塔琳娜武器混合器的首要目标之一是超越模拟ACE战术，而将演习用作真实世界实验和评估的场所。他说：“OST的最大目标是根据2018年国防战略规划和执行TTP，并响应参谋长的要求，加速变革。”。“因此，OST分为两条工作线：完善ACE战术、技术和程序，并以陌生的方式执行核心Herk能力。”随着空军各部队不断开发和完善其特定任务集的ACE外观，第19空运联队积极进行作战试验，以告知新出现的就业概念，以及C-130平台在这一更大的空军图景中的位置。“为了减少空军对大型海外基地的依赖，我们需要为决策者提供可靠的能力，整个部队必须变得更加灵活，”卡特勒说。“C-130J在地理、技术和文化上都处于完美的位置，有助于领导部队实现这一转型。”值得注意的是，ACE结构下的加油作业是OST寻求进一步评估的核心战术。在这次演习中，一架C-130J湿翼飞机向一辆R-11卡车卸下24000磅的燃油，然后在战略远征登陆场（SELF）的坡道上为两架a-10飞机加油，标志着AMC飞机首次通过TTP为CAF提供实际加油支持。“这是一项假设性能力，但据我们所知，以前从未进行过。”61岁的飞行员兼演习首席计划员亚历山大・汉弗莱上尉说。“进行燃料转移突出了该能力的一些局限性，并确定了我们在作战环境中执行此任务所需的微调。”根据卡特勒的说法，利用这个训练场地来加强对MAF和CAF资产的熟悉和整合也是OST的一个主要目标。这包括飞行两架C-130J和两架a-10沿低空航线模拟紧急情况，低成本、低空空投，磨练两支部队的空中护送技能。Cutler说：“在C-130J中，我们非常擅长在部署时所做的工作，并保持在大规模空投或空地行动中支持陆军的能力。但是，如果我们要在未来的冲突中保持灵活性和弹性，我们需要能够与空军中每一个想象得到的用户合作。“我们需要以一种有效的方式训练到不熟悉的地方，以突破我们舒适区的界限，并吸取适用于各种场景的经验教训。”他补充道。主要是在加利福尼亚州北岛海军航空站外作战，第61架战斗机为第354架FS提供的支援使A-10也能参加在加利福尼亚州二十九棕榈岛海军陆战队空地中心举行的“冬季狂暴21”海军陆战队演习。此外，C-130Js还提供了敏捷的作战空运ift在整个USMC演习期间，与5/11海军陆战队一起在加利福尼亚州彭德尔顿营地进行定位、解除定位和训练，为模拟火力执行两次高机动性火炮火箭系统（HIMARS）提升。卡特勒说：“海军陆战队做生意的方式不同于士兵或飞行员，学习如何直接与CAF用户进行计划，而无需像TACC（油轮空运控制中心）或AMD（空中机动部门）这样的中央计划机构，这是非常有价值的。”。“军队和整个政府的时间和资源都是有限的，因此我们需要能够有效地与联合部队的用户以及战士的心态进行整合。”为了让ACE发挥作用，该服务必须重新思考其运作方式。传统上，空军只有一个空军专业代码（AFSC）仅执行AFSC定义的任务和功能。然而，有了ACE，飞行员必须准备好并能够执行其他任务。这意味着小规模的飞行员团队必须具备“多功能”这就要求灵活性和变革。总体而言，OST集合了来自19空运联队内众多AFSC的25名人员，以评估多能力飞行员的概念。“我们从小石城带来的团队能够为我们在该领域面临的问题找到创造性的解决方案，”卡特勒说。“演习结束时，我们的装载机管理员在没有MPC（任务规划小组）或AMD的情况下参与了从维修到装载的计划。我们有美国海军陆战队人员支持小石城LRS（后勤准备中队），以确保我们带来的R-11燃料车能够飞回家。”卡特勒补充说，空军中的许多工作都是免费的“筒仓式”意味着军种总体上需要更好地掌握不同专业的职责或目标。“如果我们要成为CSAF和AMC指挥官所谈论的多才多艺的飞行员，我们需要提高意识，”他说。“我们的训练试图拥抱这种精神，即使在我们面临困难的时候，我们从个人和制度上都学到了难以置信的东西。”这项特别的OST证明了C-130J提供了显著的作战能力，可以直接转化为提高战斗力。汉弗莱说：“C-130J是国防部为数不多的专门用于战术空运任务的飞机之一。”。“从支持军队与CAF和USMC更深层次融合的传统角色中走出来，表明我们的社区在我们可以做什么以及我们可以作为联合作战伙伴与谁融合方面是多么灵活。”

115,AC-130U Spooky Gunship Rolls Into Retirement,"The last armed AC-130U “Spooky” gunship, tail number 513, retired to the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Ariz., Aug. 19, 2019.

This aircraft was the last AC-130U with its guns still installed and one of the very last to retire altogether.

The AC-130 has a rich history that includes support of military operations in Vietnam, Panama and Iraq as well as performing in many combat missions since it was fielded in the late 1960’s. The primary function of this aircraft was close air support, air interdiction and armed reconnaissance.

“This aircraft has provided tons of close air support,” said Brig. Gen. Brenda Cartier, Director of Operations for Air Force Special Operations Command. “There’s no telling how many lives of friendly ground forces it has saved over its time in service.”

Brig. Gen. Cartier flew the AC-130U to its final resting spot at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base from Hurlburt Field, Florida.

“It’s very bittersweet,” Cartier said. “I came onboard with the ‘Spooky’ gunships in 1997 so I’ve been with them most of my career.”

The AC-130U Spooky II and its crews have been deployed constantly for nearly two decades. The AC-130U will now be replaced by the AC-130J “Ghostrider.” AFSOC is slated to have completely converted to the fourth-series gunships in 2021. 

“The Air Force is moving to the next variant of the AC-130, the J-model, which is a very capable aircraft with new technology and a lot more weaponry,” Cartier said.

America is building a more lethal and ready Air Force through development of our warfighting capabilities.

116,Ohio native ACEs Aerospace Propulsion course,"SHEPPARD AIR FORCE BASE, Texas --
As with success, making a positive impact on someone is noticeable … after a long, long and (sometimes) tortuous process. Whether working to get good grades or working to see a friend get back on their feet you most likely won't see results right away. But that's when diligence and perseverance comes in. When people see success, that's all they see. They do not see the sweat, the calloused hands, the exhausted eyes. The people see the successful people triumphantly walking out of the fires, but not the burns on their back. Getting an award like this is not easy, but Airman 1st Class Girardot enjoys the challenge, and that's why he is one of the few to ACE this course.

117,726th ACS conducts deployment training exercise,"During the exercise, 726th Airmen aim to sharpen their skills, increase their mobility, and enhance their readiness to execute their command and control mission down range.

The orders for the exercise were issued July 9, 2019, at which time the 726th ACS began “pack up”, which is the first phase of their process to set up their operations on a simulated Mobile Operating Air Base (MOAB).

This required them to do maintenance on vehicles, inventory, vehicle weight checks, accountability of manning, and secure cargo to be transported on their Medium Tactical Vehicle (MTV).

One of the goals for the 726th ACS was to pack up their MTV’s with the shelters, communication systems, tents and tools needed for the exercise and leave for MOAB within 72 hours. 

“We’re focused on mobilizing, deploying and employing,” said Chief Master Sgt. Michael Lopez, 726th ACS director of operations.

Establishing their operating area on the MOAB requires the 726th ACS to conduct security checks, hazard checks, Chemical, Biological, Radiological Nuclear and Explosive materials (CBRNE), and Mission Oriented Protective Posture (MOPP) procedures.

Additionally, grounding circuits will be used to enable net communication equipment, radar systems and generators to be set up and remain secure and protected from electrical damage. They’ll also be able to communicate with the various fighter squadrons who are participating in Gunfighter Flag.

“The whole point of the exercise is to increase readiness,” said Lt. Col. Richard Barber, 726th ACS commander. “We want to focus on cultivating those skill sets needed to mobilize our system.”

118,Guardians of the Last Frontier honor triple ace,"EIELSON AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska ― “I feel that I could probably take on the whole North Korean army myself right now,” said the 43-year-old from Los Angeles. “You are bulletproof once you grow a mustache ― that’s straight from Robin Olds.” 

This quote is from a 2018 Stars and Stripes article about Airmen at Kunsan Air Base, South Korea, celebrating “Mustache March” and remembering the service of Robin Olds. 

Olds was a triple ace, scoring his first 12 kills while flying a P-38 Lighting and P-51 Mustang during World War II. During the Vietnam War he flew the F-4 Phantom, shooting down four enemy jets, and growing his iconic handlebar mustache. 

“It became the middle finger I couldn’t raise in the [public relations] photographs,” Olds once said. “The mustache became my silent last word in the verbal battles … with higher headquarters on rules, targets and fighting the war.”

Many of those who serve now might not be looking for a way to “raise the middle finger as a silent word,” yet Airmen of the 168th Wing did observe the distinguished aviator.
 
Chief Master Sgt. Clint Miller, 168th Logistics Readiness Squadron vehicle fleet manager, said, “I support Mustache March in honor of Robin Olds and my perception of the spirit of the USAF. The innovators that tread on the fringes of our established norms and sometimes blast through the barriers of how we do things are a unique breed and this simple, unruly, ‘out of regs’ mustache is my salute to thinking outside of the box.”

Several of them said they participated in the annual event to show respect, honor and thankfulness to the legendary heroes and patriots of our Air Force past. Others spoke about Air Force heritage and leadership by example, or how growing a mustache is a conversation starter that allowed them to talk about Air Force history while paying homage to those who paved the way for today’s Airmen.
 
Some unit members had different interpretations of Mustache March.
 
One deployed Airman said, “I mainly do it to be comic relief. March happened to be the last full month of my deployment and I knew that letting it grow out would be some cheap entertainment for my flight over here.”

Entertainment motivated many unit members to grow mustaches, knowing that their haphazardly grown facial hair would start dialogues or sometimes incite laughter, both motives that boosted unit morale and camaraderie.
 
For reasons unknown, a large number of maintenance personnel take part in the tradition.
 
“I participate in Mustache March because it is part of our Air Force heritage from a time when our country was in a bit of political turmoil and an Air Force officer decided to push back a little about things that didn’t matter and tried to focus our Airmen on things that did matter. I think we need to get there again,” said Master Sgt. Ray Allen, production superintendent with the 168th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron.

Maybe it is fitting to close this out with an Airman who has been a member of the 168th Wing since its inception in 1986, Senior Master Sgt. Bob Fine, 168th Maintenance Group plans and scheduling noncommissioned officer in charge.

Fine is currently deployed to Southwest Asia and said, “It’s a tradition every year in maintenance [so] I thought I would get a jump on growing my ‘just because I can’ facial hair heading into retirement.”
 
He will retire this year shortly after returning home.

119,CIWT Cryptology Courses Undergo ACE Review,"PENSACOLA, Fla. -- Members of the American Council on Education (ACE) visited the Center for Information Warfare Training (CIWT) to evaluate six cryptology courses offered by the Information Warfare Training Command (IWTC) Corry Station, May 1-2.

The team reviewed five courses related to the cryptologic technician (technical) (CTT) rating as well as the Cryptologic Warfare Officer Basic Course. Their review included an examination of each course curriculum as well as interviews with enlisted and senior enlisted CTTs.

ACE recommends equivalent college credits for members of the armed forces for certain types of military training and service experiences, based on high quality standards of practice. They provide a collaborative link between the U.S. Department of Defense and higher education through their evaluation process.

“We want to ensure our Sailors are getting their skills reflected as college credits that will help them not only advance professionally, but also help them along the path to success when they transition to the civilian world,” said Denise Myers from CIWT’s training directorate. “We ensure that our courses are up to date with the latest industry requirements and what they are learning is relevant outside of the Navy as well.”

ACE occupation reviews are focused on validating the Navy’s job standards and expectations. Before the interviews begin, faculty evaluators review the occupation description, occupation standards, job task analysis and manuals used on the job.

A final report that outlines the consensus on the alignment of credit recommendations for the occupation is usually completed by the ACE team within 30 working days of the evaluation. The credit recommendations determined by ACE appear on the service member’s Joint Services Transcript (JST).

Each of the ratings taught at CIWT receives an ACE evaluation every 10 years at a minimum.

120,A guide to ace-ing the new academic year,"School starts on Aug. 7 and 8 for Hawaii’s public school students, and many campuses are hosting orientations, school-supply drop-offs and other new-school events to get students and parents ready to get back in the classrooms. (See the list of orientations below or contact your child’s school for more information.)

This is especially helpful for military families who are constantly on the move and must regularly navigate the process of enrolling children in a new school system. 

The Hawaii State Department of Education estimates that the Aloha State is the temporary or long-term home for over 300,000 military personnel and their families. Military children make up about 8 percent of the state’s public school enrollment and Hawaii has the highest number of military dependent children per capita in the nation, according to the HIDOE website.

“Going to these orientations gives families an opportunity to meet the principal, staff and teachers at their child’s school,” said Cherry Torres Okahara, the military school liaison for HIDOE. 

She said that parents who reach out to the schools and the various military School Liaison Offices are less likely to be stressed because they have taken the opportunity to have their questions answered and concerns addressed. 

She also encouraged military families to familiarize themselves with their children’s school curriculum and interests. Students who join clubs or try out for sports are more likely to be involved in their new school and less likely feel alienated and homesick, she said. 

The HIDOE has many resources to help military families with school-age children, including a page on its website dedicated to answering those questions most frequently asked by service members (visit hawaiipublicschools.org and search “military faq”). 

What follows is a roundup of general information to help families start the school year on the right foot. (More specific information may be found by visiting hawaiipublicschools.org and searching “how to enroll.”)

Bus Service
School bus service is available for students from kindergarten to fifth grade who live a mile or more from their school. It’s available to students in sixth to 12th grade who live a mile and a half or more from their school. Students who do not meet these criteria may be able to receive the service on a space available basis. 

Free bus passes are available to students who qualify for HIDOE’s free lunch program, students who are foster children, students who are homeless, students whose special education plan includes regular transportation as a related service, students who are directed to attend a school outside their district and students who have three older siblings who are fare-paying bus riders. 

For more information on the school bus program, including cost and routes, visit your school’s office and the HIDOE website (hawaiischools.org and search “bus service”). 

Takai Transition Centers
Named for the late U.S. Rep. Mark Takai, these transition centers and their affiliated programs connect new students with student ambassadors who conduct school tours, arrange group lunches and offer social and academic support throughout the school year.

Most of the Army-impacted schools on the island have a Takai Transition Center.

Torres Okahara singled out the centers at Leilehua High School and Aliamanu Elementary School as being outstanding examples. 
Daniel K. Inouye Elementary School and Solomon Elementary School on Schofield Barracks also have Takai Transition Centers as does Wheeler Elementary and Middle schools. 

Contact your child’s school to find out whether it has a Takai Transition Center on campus.  

Traffic and Safety
With the start of the school year comes increased traffic. Guardians dropping off students in the morning and picking them up after school should plan accordingly.

Also, be aware of policies regarding school-age children on any of U.S. Army Garrison-Hawaii’s installations. Children younger than 10 are not allowed to be unsupervised at bus stops, recreation areas and public facilities, nor are they allowed to walk to or from school alone. 

Motorists should be aware of increased pedestrian traffic near schools and crosswalks and exercise caution. 

7th Grade Physical Exams
New for the 2017-2018 academic school year is the HIDOE requirement that all students complete a physical examination one year prior to enrolling in the seventh grade. These exams are covered by the Affordable Healthcare Act. For more information visit hawaiipublicschools.org and search “7th grade physical exam.”

Under Construction
Construction at the new Solomon Elementary School campus on Schofield Barracks will be underway during the upcoming school year. Because the new campus is adjacent to the current campus, the school has had to make some adjustments. 

? A barrier around the construction site will help mitigate noise.
?The kindergarten playground gate will open at 7:30 a.m. and families with strollers may congregate there before the first school bell rings at 7:50 a.m. The Designated stroller areas will conserve space, which will be extremely limited due to construction.  
?The gate at the corner of Trimble and Carpenter streets will no longer be available; families are asked to access the campus through the other available gates. 
?The school’s courtyard will be closed for improvements to create additional green space. The surrounding walkways will be congested. Families, especially those with strollers, are asked wish their first to fifth grade students well in the front play space. Staff will be available to help students find their classrooms.

121,ACS helping soldiers after hurricane Matthew,"The Center provides emergency food assistance, legal assistance for damage claims, evacuation travel order assistance and Military Family Life Counselors assistance. The Center is a central location for any help Soldiers, family members and retirees may need.
	The EFAC will help provide short and long-term recovery aid to anyone around Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Airfield. After hurricane Matthew, people who had been affected by the storm are looking for any help they can get. 
	“We went through a similar situation with the tornado in February,” said Tonya Imus, the Supervisory Mobilization, Deployment and Stability Support Operations program manager here. “People feel overwhelmed after a severe weather incident. They don’t want to run all over post looking for the help they need.”
	Imus’s home is still without power. Despite this, she still helped set up the EFAC so that people can get the help that they need. 
	“We assist people to help themselves,” said Imus. “It’s about getting people back to the new normal as quickly as possible.”
	Throughout the day there was a steady stream of Soldiers and families that were looking for recovery assistance from the hurricane. One such Soldier who was seeking aid at the EFAC was Spc. Cronje Helm, a cable systems installer-maintainer with the 123rd Division Signal Battalion. 
Helm is living in the barracks on post and needed to replace the perishables he lost due to the hurricane. The EFAC was offering vouchers to help anyone who had suffered from this.  
	“I was crushed to lose the food,” said Helm. “I got the message about the food vouchers and felt that there was some hope left.”
	Service providers at the EFAC help Soldiers such as Helm receive the help that they need. One service provider is James Fleming, the Financial Readiness program manager at the EFAC. Fleming was one of the main individuals responsible for helping Soldiers, family members and retirees receive food assistance. 
	“We’ve had a plethora of individuals come in to assist the Soldiers, family members and retirees whose homes have been damaged during the hurricane,” Fleming said. “It warms your heart to provide assistance to those individuals that are in need.”",2016/10/12,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/212384/acs-helping-soldiers-after-hurricane-matthew,"FORT STEWART, GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佐治亚州斯图尔特堡,飓风“马修”过后，ACS在帮助士兵,该中心提供紧急食品援助、损害索赔的法律援助、疏散旅行订单援助和军事家庭生活顾问援助。该中心是士兵、家庭成员和退休人员可能需要的任何帮助的中心。EFAC将帮助斯图尔特堡和亨特陆军机场周围的任何人提供短期和长期恢复援助。“马修”飓风过后，受飓风影响的人们正在寻求他们能得到的任何帮助。“我们在2月份经历了类似的龙卷风情况，”监管动员、部署和稳定支持行动项目经理Tonya Imus说。“在恶劣天气事件后，人们感到不知所措。他们不想到处奔波寻找他们需要的帮助。”艾默斯的家仍然没有电。尽管如此，她仍然帮助建立了EFAC，以便人们能够得到他们需要的帮助。“我们帮助人们自助，”伊默斯说。“这是为了让人们尽快回到新的正常状态。”一整天都有源源不断的士兵和家庭从飓风中寻求恢复援助。其中一名在EFAC寻求帮助的士兵是Spc.Cronje Helm，他是123师信号营的电缆系统安装维护人员。赫尔姆住在哨所的营房里，需要更换因飓风而丢失的易腐物品。EFAC正在提供代金券，以帮助任何遭受这种情况的人。“我被压垮了，失去了食物，”赫尔姆说。“我得到了关于食品券的信息，觉得还有一些希望。”EFAC的服务提供商帮助士兵，如赫尔姆，获得他们需要的帮助。其中一家服务提供商是EFAC财务准备项目经理詹姆斯・弗莱明（James Fleming）。弗莱明是负责帮助士兵、家庭成员和退休人员获得粮食援助的主要人员之一。弗莱明说：“我们已经有过多的人前来帮助在飓风中房屋遭到破坏的士兵、家庭成员和退休人员。”。“为那些需要帮助的人提供帮助会温暖你的心。”
122,Longtime ACS volunteer to be recognized with award for service,"JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, Va. - As a volunteer with Army Community Service on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, retired Army Lt. Col. C.J. Buche contributed 3,758 hours of service over five years. In April, she’ll receive the Emma Marie Baird Award at the JBM-HH Volunteer Recognition Award Ceremony for her efforts.

The award is presented annually by the Department of the Army in recognition of those who have contributed “outstanding service” to ACS, according to the award’s official website.

Buche is an Army veteran and military spouse to retired Army Lt. Col. Joe Buche, former commander of the 3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard). She began her volunteer work when she was still in uniform, working as a Family Readiness Group adviser to help Soldiers and their families find necessary resources and prepare for deployments.

After retiring from the Army, Buche said she volunteered in her local community and at church, and while those were great experiences, she missed that connection she had forged with Soldiers and their loved ones.

“For me, I get so much out of interacting with people,” Buche told the Pentagram. “In Northern Virginia, you can kind of blend into the local community and not do a whole lot with the military ... I found that I missed the connection to Soldiers and their families. Having grown up in the military, if you will, being able to share that was really cool.”

During her time with ACS, Buche worked as the ACS Volunteer Board president, ACS Volunteer supervisor and a front desk volunteer.

As volunteer board president and volunteer supervisor, Buche raised funds, supervised and trained 26 volunteers and recruited new volunteers.

She also organized holiday toy drives specifically for Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall from 2012 to 2014, distributing donated toys to more 1,100 Army and Marine children on the joint base. Of her many accomplishments, Buche is most proud of the toy drive.

“When a Soldier picked up a toy for his daughter and said, ‘This is exactly the one she wants,’ it was awesome,” Buche said.

The Emma Marie Baird Award for Outstanding Volunteer Service was established in August 1988 in memory of the late retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Emma Marie Baird, considered the founder of Army Community Service.

“I am truly honored and humbled to receive this particular award,” Buche said. “To receive an award that acknowledges the contributions of an Army officer who was also a woman and a volunteer means quite a bit.”

But Buche stressed that she wouldn’t have been able to do any of her work alone, and thanked the many people who made it possible along the way.

“Nothing I have done was done on my own,” she said. “Everything I did was done by a whole lot of other people helping and a whole lot of people for inspiration. That applies to ACS and to everywhere that I’ve been.”

In addition to her work with ACS, Buche also volunteered at the Fort Myer Thrift Shop and at the chapel. Before coming to JBM-HH, Buche volunteered at Fort Belvoir with the Army Family Team Building (AFTB) and Army Family Action Plan (AFAP) programs. She and her husband now live in Yorktown, Pennsylvania.

“I’ve gotten a whole lot in life and I would like to be able to give back, and it sure feels good when I do,” she said.

123,ACS celebrates volunteers during annual luncheon,"JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, Va. - Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall Army Community Service celebrated its many volunteers during its annual volunteer recognition luncheon Nov. 6.

Those who give their time to ACS programs were treated to a lunch in the executive room at Spates Community Club on the Fort Myer portion of the joint base.

About 24 volunteers C the majority of whom work in the ACS reception area and on other special projects throughout the year C were recognized, said Marcia O’Connor, the ACS volunteer board vice president and assistant volunteer supervisor.

Laurie Brown, chief of ACS, thanked all of the volunteers who attended the luncheon, as well as those who were unable to attend.

“We do have volunteers in many capacities, and many of them are volunteering today in other capacities, so we do appreciate all of you being here,” she said.

Brown told the volunteers in the room that they might not know the impact they have on the people they meet through their work every day.

“One of my favorite quotes is ‘To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world,’” she said. “We have the opportunity every day to witness this when it comes to our volunteers.

“You may never know the profound effect you have on a person’s life. A kind word, a gentle touch, a listening ear can mean so much to someone who is seeking service.”

And whether they volunteered at the ACS front desk, knitted baby blankets for Soldiers and their families or worked in one of ACS’ many special projects, Brown assured volunteers that they help their community.

“You make a difference in others’ lives,” she said. “You may volunteer for many different reasons, but for whatever reason you volunteer, you provide support, skills, talents and abilities to the joint base and to the Army as a whole.”

Mike Jordan, president of the ACS volunteer board, has only held his position since May, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t understand the great difference volunteers make for ACS, he said.

“I really appreciate what your volunteering means to the great folks in the Army Community Service programs,” Jordan said. “I also know, even more significantly, how your selfless service translates to improving quality of life programs for service members and their families. Very often, they’re survivors.”

During his keynote speech, JBM-HH Chief of Staff Glenn Wait said ACS volunteers contributed 2,225 total hours for Fiscal Year 2015, the equivalent of $51,342 in the private sector.

“Without volunteers, we wouldn’t be able to do what we do,” Wait said. “It just means so much.”

Volunteering takes understanding, empathy, compassion, patience and dedication, according to Wait.

“You’ve shown these qualities and much more,” he said. “Throughout the last year we have seen your enthusiastic community spirit and dedicated volunteer service. Your unwavering demonstration of support reflects positively on your values of patriotism, generosity and selfless dedication.”

On behalf of himself and JBM-HH Commander Col. Mike Henderson, Wait offered his heartfelt thanks to everyone who gives their time for ACS programs.

“You’re part of the ACS family,” he said. “Regardless of your role I want you to know that this command is deeply grateful for you.”",2015/11/6,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/181828/acs-celebrates-volunteers-during-annual-luncheon,"JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州迈尔-亨德森大厅联合基地,ACS在年度午餐会上庆祝志愿者,迈尔-亨德森大厅联合基地，弗吉尼亚州-迈尔・亨德森・霍尔联合基地陆军社区服务部在11月6日的年度志愿者表彰午餐会上庆祝了其众多志愿者。那些花时间参加ACS项目的志愿者在联合基地迈尔堡部分斯帕茨社区俱乐部的行政室享用了午餐。约有24名志愿者，其中大部分是志愿者ACS志愿者委员会副主席兼助理志愿者主管Marcia O'Connor说，ACS接待区和全年其他特殊项目的工作都得到了认可。ACS负责人劳里・布朗感谢所有参加午餐会的志愿者以及无法参加午餐会的志愿者。她说：“我们确实有很多能力的志愿者，他们中的许多人今天也以其他能力做志愿者，所以我们非常感谢你们所有人来到这里。”布朗告诉房间里的志愿者，他们可能不知道他们每天的工作会对他们遇到的人产生什么影响。“我最喜欢的一句话是‘对世界而言，你可能是一个人，但对某个人来说，你可能是全世界’，”她说，“我们每天都有机会在志愿者面前见证这一点。“你可能永远不会知道你对一个人的生活有多么深远的影响。一句好话、一次温柔的抚摸、一只倾听的耳朵对寻求服务的人来说意义重大。”无论他们是在ACS前台志愿服务，还是为士兵和他们的家人编织婴儿毛毯，还是在ACS的许多特殊项目中工作，布朗都向志愿者保证，他们会帮助他们的社区。“你会改变别人的生活，”她说。“你可以出于许多不同的原因志愿服务，但无论出于何种原因，你都会为联合基地和整个军队提供支持、技能、才能和能力。”迈克・乔丹（Mike Jordan）是ACS志愿者委员会的主席，他从5月份才开始担任这一职务，但这并不意味着他不理解志愿者对ACS的巨大影响，他说：“我真的很感激你的志愿工作对军队社区服务项目中的伟大人物意味着什么。”。“我还知道，更重要的是，你的无私服务如何转化为改善服务人员及其家庭的生活质量。他们通常是幸存者。”JBM-HH办公室主任格伦・韦特（Glenn Wait）在其主旨演讲中表示，ACS志愿者为2015财年贡献了2225小时的总时数，相当于私营部门的51342美元。“没有志愿者，我们就无法做我们所做的事情，”韦特说。“这意义重大。”根据Wait的说法，志愿工作需要理解、同理心、同情心、耐心和奉献精神。“你已经展示了这些品质，还有更多，”他说。“在过去的一年中，我们看到你们热情的社区精神和奉献的志愿服务。你们坚定不移的支持体现了你们的爱国主义、慷慨和无私奉献的价值观。”Wait代表他自己和JBM-HH指挥官迈克・亨德森上校向所有为ACS项目付出时间的人表示衷心的感谢。“你是ACS大家庭的一部分，”他说。“无论你扮演什么角色，我都希望你知道，这个司令部对你深表感谢。”
124,"Bagels, coffee and history served up by ACS","JOINT BASE MYER-HENDERSON HALL, Va. - Bagels, coffee, juice and the history of Army Community Service’s 50 years of service to the Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall community were served up June 24 at Building 201 on the Fort Myer portion of the joint base.

The event marked the last in a series of events commemorating ACS’s golden anniversary and brought dozens to the building. ACS staff members and volunteers discussed the importance of their organization. 

Carla Moss, ACS information and referral/outreach program manager, said having that interaction with the community is the best part of her job.

“To be able to share and give back to the community is so important,” she said.

Throughout the building, displays were set up that told the JBM-HH ACS story across the decades. Scrapbooks were filled with photographs and newspaper clippings dating back to the 1960s. On a coat rack near the entrance door to the building hung a brown skirt and blazer and orange blouse that was the uniform for ACS volunteers decades ago.

Mary Cargill of the ACS New Parent Support Program, said helping service members who give so much is the most important aspect of her job.

“Helping people that give so much, our Soldiers and Marines give so much, their families give so much, that is the best,” she said.

Army Community Service was designed to provide a framework for the operation of a viable system of social services within the Army community and was “born” July 25, 1965, when Gen. Harold K. Johnson, then-Army chief of staff, sent a letter to all commanders announcing the approval and establishment of ACS, according to an article on Army.mil. With the publication of Army Regulation 608-1 on Nov. 19, 1965, ACS was formalized. 

ACS opened its doors on the Fort Myer portion of the joint base in the spring of 1966, according to ACS Chief Laurie Brown.

125,Defenders compete in Aces Cop Combat Challenge,"MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE, Mont. - Security forces personnel from Malmstrom Air Force Base had the chance to compete for first place during the Fourth Annual Aces Cop Combat Challenge held on base June 5. During the competition, Airmen were required to work in teams of four and push themselves to their physical and mental limits to complete each station of the event in record time.

Throughout the 22 stations, team members solved critical thinking scenarios, performed physical feats, combined their efforts to defeat mental games, assembled firearms from pieces and displayed expert marksmanship skills, all while under constant duress and physical stress. 

“This competition is very physically challenging,” said Staff Sgt. Joann Ayon, 341st Security Forces Group competition judge. 

The infamous Team Pain station required participants to complete five staggered push-ups in a mud pit, flip a massive tire four times and repeat the entire process for 15 minutes, or until the point of exhaustion. 

The Chemical Warfare and Box of Guns stations tested competitors’ career-specific understanding while creating an environment where without the help and combined knowledge of each team member, success would be impossible.

“Teamwork and a lot of strategy [helped us accomplish each station],” said Senior Airman John Carlson, 341st Missile Security Forces Squadron member. “I think these events definitely help to build that teamwork also.”

In total, 18 teams participated in the competition.

“This is my second year participating in the challenge,” said Carlson. “The hardest part is the physical aspect of each event and keeping that teamwork.” 

According to Carlson, being able to participate in the event was something his entire team was very excited about and they trained intensely in order to be prepared for what they were about to undertake. 

The 341st Tactical Response Force fire team earned the championship title and bragging rights until next year’s competition.

Malmstrom’s 341st MSFS team came in second and the 341st Security Forces Squadron fire team took third. 

As home to one of the largest security forces groups in the U.S. Air Force, the competition served to strengthen the bond of Malmstrom’s security forces members. Success of the event was only made possible due to volunteers, spectators and most importantly, the competitors.",2015/6/8,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/165907/defenders-compete-aces-cop-combat-challenge,"MALMSTROM AIR FORCE BASE, MT, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国蒙特州马尔姆斯特罗姆空军基地,防守者参加Aces Cop战斗挑战赛,蒙大拿州马尔姆斯特罗姆空军基地6月5日，在基地举行的第四届年度Aces Cop战斗挑战赛中，来自马尔姆斯特罗姆空军基地的安全部队人员有机会争夺第一名。在比赛期间，飞行员被要求四人一组工作，并竭尽全力以创纪录的时间完成比赛的每一站。在22个站中，队员们解决了批判性思维场景，完成了身体壮举，共同努力击败心理游戏，在不断的胁迫和身体压力下，用碎片组装枪支，展示出专业的射击技能。341安全部队团体竞赛评委Joann Ayon上士说：“这场比赛在身体上非常具有挑战性。”。臭名昭著的团队疼痛站要求参与者在泥坑中完成五次错开的俯卧撑，翻转一个巨大的轮胎四次，然后重复整个过程15分钟，或者直到筋疲力尽。化学战和枪械箱站测试了竞争对手对职业的理解，同时创造了一个没有团队成员的帮助和综合知识就不可能成功的环境。“团队合作和大量战略（帮助我们完成了每个站），”高级飞行员约翰・卡尔森说，341导弹安全部队中队成员。“我认为这些活动肯定也有助于建立团队精神。”总共有18支球队参加了比赛。“这是我第二年参加挑战赛，”卡尔森说。卡尔森说：“最困难的部分是每项活动的身体状况以及保持团队精神。”能够参加这项活动是他的整个团队非常兴奋的事情，他们进行了紧张的训练，以便为即将进行的活动做好准备。第341战术反应部队消防队赢得了冠军头衔，并在明年的比赛前拥有自夸的权利。马尔姆斯特罗姆的第341战术反应部队消防队获得了第二名，第341安全部队中队消防队获得了第三名。作为美国空军最大的安全部队组织之一的所在地，这次比赛加强了马尔姆斯特罗姆安全部队成员之间的联系。只有志愿者、观众，最重要的是竞争对手，比赛才能取得成功。

“In the world we live in today with our near-peer adversaries, it’s very likely in our next conflict that we won’t have (traditional) ground support,” said Capt. Jacob Impellizzeri, 79th Fighter Squadron F-16 pilot. “In the event we land in contingency operations, my wingmen and I need to know how to post-flight these jets, and prepare them for potential combat sorties.”

Simulating an environment of ACE models, the pilots trained on how service and turn their own aircraft and potentially launch again to continue delivering sorties. The maintenance team trained alongside one another as well to better develop each other in multi-capable concepts.

“We trained here on tasks like servicing fuel, oil, hydraulics, and serviceability through inspections,” said Staff Sgt. Zachary Szalay, 79th Fighter Generation Squadron crew chief. “This training is important because it provides the opportunity for all of us to become more well-rounded in other fields.”

Fielding the exercise at MCAS Beaufort was necessary to participate in a joint training opportunity fostering interoperability between the services as well as simulate an environment for our pilots without the support offered by their home station.

Capt. Impellizzeri further explained that tomorrow’s conflict requires the team to continue building towards the idea of operating in the unknown and preparing for all possibilities.

“We need to be more agile, and flexible about how we fight our next wars,” said Impellizzeri. “This entire week that we’re down here is only proving that point.”",2021/5/24,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/397333/shaw-airmen-execute-ace-concepts-mcas-beaufort,"SHAW AIR FORCE BASE, SC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国南卡罗来纳州肖空军基地,肖空军在MCAS博福特执行ACE概念,F-16“毒蛇”战斗机的发射需要一个由经过积极训练的维修飞行员和战备飞行员组成的团队。他们一起将飞机送入天空，执行空中近距离支援、压制敌人防空系统，以及根据空中任务指令执行的其他任务。然而，随着未来战斗向更为严峻的目标迈进，整个团队都在进行训练，以期在应急地点作战。5月17日至21日，来自第20战斗机联队的一小队飞行员和维修飞行员在海军陆战队博福特空军站进行了敏捷作战使用功能的训练。第79战斗机中队F-16飞行员雅各布・利泽里上尉说：“在我们今天与近邻对手共同生活的世界中，我们很可能在下一次冲突中没有（传统的）地面支援。”。“如果我们在应急行动中着陆，我的僚机和我需要知道如何对这些飞机进行后置飞行，并为可能的战斗架次做好准备。”在模拟ACE模型的环境中，飞行员们训练如何维修和转动自己的飞机，并可能再次发射以继续交付架次。维修团队彼此并肩训练，以便更好地在多功能概念方面相互发展。第79代战斗机中队队长扎卡里・萨莱上士说：“我们在这里接受了燃料、油、液压和检查维修等任务的培训。这次培训很重要，因为它为我们所有人提供了在其他领域更加全面的机会。”在MCAS Beaufort部署演习对于参加联合训练机会、促进军种之间的互操作性以及在没有母站支持的情况下为我们的飞行员模拟环境是必要的。Pumplezzeri上尉进一步解释说，明天的冲突需要团队继续建设“我们需要更灵活，更灵活地对待下一场战争，”利泽里说，“我们在这里呆了整整一周，这只是证明了这一点。”
127,POL drives ACE during Exercise Mobility Guardian,"Air Mobility Command petroleum, oils and lubricants Airmen pushed the boundaries of Agile Combat Employment and how it pertains to expeditiously refueling aircraft during Exercise Mobility Guardian, May 15-27, 2021.
 
Throughout the exercise, POL Airmen received hands-on training on the Aerial Bulk Fuel Delivery System, Fuels Operational Readiness Capability Equipment mobile fuel bladder, wet-wing defuel and hot-pit refuel operations.
 
“Without fuel, the Air Force mission does not get accomplished,” said Staff Sgt. Garrett Huntoon, 374th Logistic Readiness Squadron fuels service center controller. “Mobility Guardian offers a training environment to test capabilities of how we can provide fuel in different environments and change the way we get after ACE.”
 
The ABFDS, a portable 3,000-gallon fuel bladder, can be loaded on a C-130J Super Hercules, C-5 Galaxy, or C-17 Globemaster III and transported anywhere around the world. A fighter, helicopter or ground vehicle simply pulls next to the respective aircraft and receives fuel while engines remain on, allowing them to quickly refuel and carry on with the mission with minimal time spent on the ground.
 
“The Air Force is taking notice and seeing the capabilities the ABFDS brings to the fight and is pushing that concept forward,” said Master Sgt. Jared Bicker, Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center Fuels operator. “If we want to maintain that flexibility and air combat effectiveness, then we need exercises like this to push initiatives such as these that make an impact on the way we operate.”
 
FORCE is a 210,000-gallon bladder that is generally set up in deployed environments negating the need to build hardened tanks or bring fuel trucks, while simultaneously reducing the overall footprint by not leaving hardened facilities behind.
 
“By reducing the footprint, these refueling initiatives allow aircraft to continuously hop around a wide array of locations within shorter timeframes C exponentially boosting capabilities and keeping the enemy guessing,” Huntoon said.
 
POL also participates in wet-wing defueling and hot-pit refueling operations. While neither of these concepts are new, under the scope of contingency operations, these are not commonly executed within the same mission set. 

Wet-wing defueling is the offloading of fuel from an aircraft onto an R-11 fuel truck, all while engines are still running. POL can then turn and hot-pit refuel a fighter aircraft. Hot-pit refueling occurs when an aircraft is fueled immediately after landing, while the aircraft keeps one engine running.
 
These refueling capabilities showcase the agility of mobility aircraft while demonstrating the global reach AMC provides across the Air Force.  
 
“This exercise is conducive to a more effective and agile Air Force,” said Master Sgt. Patrick King, AMC logistics readiness manager. “AMC POL Airmen generally don’t get hands-on time with these operations unless they are in a deployed environment. Mobility Guardian offers an opportunity to experiment with these concepts before having to use them in a real-world scenario.”",2021/5/23,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/397146/pol-drives-ace-during-exercise-mobility-guardian,"ALPENA COMBAT READINESS TRAINING CENTER, MI, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国密苏里州阿尔皮纳战备训练中心,POL在运动中驾驶ACE Guardian,2021年5月15日至27日，在《机动性卫报》演习中，空军机动司令部石油、机油和润滑油飞行员突破了敏捷作战部署的界限，以及如何为飞机快速加油。在整个演习过程中，波兰航空兵接受了有关空中散装燃料输送系统的实际操作培训，燃料战备能力装备移动燃料囊、湿翼除油和热坑加油作业。第374后勤战备中队燃料服务中心控制员、参谋长Garrett Huntoon说：“没有燃料，空军任务无法完成。”。“Mobility Guardian提供了一个训练环境，以测试我们如何在不同环境中提供燃料，以及如何在ACE后改变我们获得燃料的方式。”ABFDS是一种便携式3000加仑燃料囊，可装载在C-130J超级大力神、C-5银河系或C-17 Globemaster III上，并运输到世界各地。战斗机、直升机或地面车辆只需靠近各自的飞机，并在发动机保持打开的情况下接收燃油，使其能够快速加油并以最少的地面时间执行任务。阿尔皮纳战备训练中心燃料操作员Jared Bicker上士说：“空军正在注意并看到ABFDS为战斗带来的能力，并正在推进这一概念。”。“如果我们想保持这种灵活性和空战效能，那么我们需要这样的演习来推动对我们作战方式产生影响的举措。”FORCE是一个210000加仑的气囊，通常安装在部署环境中，无需建造硬化油箱或携带燃油卡车，同时通过不留下硬化设施来减少总体占地面积。“通过减少足迹，这些加油计划使飞机能够在较短的时间内连续在广泛的地点跳跃，从而成倍提高能力，并保持敌人的猜测。”Huntoon说。POL还参与湿翼除油和热坑加油作业。虽然这两个概念都不是新概念，但在应急行动范围内，这些概念通常不会在同一任务集内执行。湿翼除油是将飞机的燃油卸载到R-11燃料车上，同时发动机为still运行。POL可以转弯并对战斗机进行热坑加油。热坑加油发生在飞机着陆后立即加油，同时飞机保持一个发动机运行。这些加油能力展示了机动飞机的灵活性，同时展示了AMC在整个空军中提供的全球覆盖范围。陆军装备司令部后勤准备经理帕特里克・金上士说：“这次演习有助于建立一支更有效、更灵活的空军。”。“AMC POL飞行员通常不会亲自参与这些行动，除非他们处于部署环境中。Mobility Guardian提供了一个机会，在将这些概念用于实际场景之前，可以对其进行试验。”
128,167th and 175th demonstrate ACE concept in training exercise,"The 167th Airlift Wing recently teamed up with the 175th Wing, Maryland Air National Guard, to conduct their first agile combat employment exercise Feb. 17.
During the single-day exercise, cargo and Airmen were transported via a C-17 Globemaster III from Warfield Air National Guard Base at Martin State Airport, Baltimore, Md.,
to Martinsburg, W.Va. Two A-10C Thunderbolt II aircraft joined the equipment and personnel to mimic operations from a forward location.
Capt. Trebor Taylor, C-17 pilot and exercise planner said the primary goal was to help another unit. The objective was to transport their cargo and personnel to Martinsburg,
set up their equipment and operate out of this location, simulating an austere environment, and the exercise accomplished that.
“The unit is fully deployed forward and you’re able to take a chunk of your organic elements and move them elsewhere and be able to operate at both places,” he said.
“So essentially, you’re doing more with less.”
A forecasted snowstorm forced participants to shorten the exercise from two days to one, but Taylor said it created a secondary element to the training, requiring the
movement of cargo and people quicker, efficiently, and safely.
The ACE exercise also provided unique training opportunities to the C-17 aircrew and aerial port specialists, requiring them to work with equipment specifically for the A-10.
During the exercise Airmen moved 44,000 pounds of cargo, including MJ-1B/C Bomblifts, GF-7/E Ammo Loading Systems, and MHU-141 Bomb Trailers.

129,Fort Leavenworth ACS launching volunteer management system,"Katie Peterson | Fort Leavenworth Lamp

FORT LEAVENWORTH, Kansas (Jan. 7, 2021) ― After three years of planning and development, U.S. Army Installation Management Command and Army Community Service are launching a new Volunteer Management Information System Jan. 11. 
“(VMIS) is an online program that helps volunteers track their volunteer hours so that their volunteer hours are certified,” said interim Fort Leavenworth ACS Volunteer Coordinator Jessica Brushwood. “We have points of contact that oversee the system for their organization. After a volunteer enters their hours, that person certifies the hours.” 
Brushwood said the new VMIS is a modernized update from the previous system. 
“The last system was very old and … ‘glitchy,’ so people had a lot of issues with accessing it on certain browsers or they would go in and not find the information they needed,” Brushwood said. “It was not a really intelligent system, so there were some functions that it could’ve done that it didn’t do.
“(The new VMIS) is something that is accessible from anywhere, so it keeps their volunteer history. It is going to be a lot more streamlined and modernized and easier to access,” she said. “For soldiers working toward the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, they need a certain document to put in for that medal; (VMIS) will actually generate that document for them.” 
All service members, family members and Department of the Army civilians volunteering on Fort Leavenworth can use the new VMIS system, logged under Army Family Web Portal. Service members can also log hours volunteered at off-post organizations upon providing a memo proving the hours to Brushwood.
Brushwood said she has high hopes for the new system.
“My overall hope is that the system will be easier to use and that more people will want to use it as a result so that we have more people logging their volunteer hours,” Brushwood said. “The Army likes to know how much money they’ve saved based on the number of volunteer hours that we have.
“(The Army) also uses volunteer hours sometimes to justify a needed position,” she said. “If they see lots of volunteers (performing) a certain job and that there’s lots of volunteer hours going toward a certain job, they may use that to justify hiring somebody to do that job.”
Volunteers who have logged hours on the old system will have their hours automatically transferred over to the new system. 
New volunteers can visit www.armyfamilywebportal.com before Jan. 11 and https://vmis.armyfamilywebportal.com after Jan. 11 to register.

130,305th AMW supports ACE exercise Razor Talon,"A C-17 Globemaster III and four KC-10 Extenders from the 305th Air Mobility Wing supported the multiday exercise Razor Talon at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina, Dec. 1-4. 

While the KC-10s have been a participant in Razor Talon since the exercise was established nearly a decade ago, this was the first time that the C-17 participated. 

“The 305th’s role in exercises like Razor Talon just go to show how vital rapid global mobility is to what the Air Force and Department of Defense does,” said Col. Scott Wiederholt, 305th Air Mobility Wing commander. “We provide a stable and solid backbone to combat employment by enabling the air and ground fights through fuels, cargo, personnel and more.” 

Razor Talon is a quarterly Agile Combat Employment and large-force composite training exercise that allows the Air Force to train in a fully-developed threat scenario environment with joint and combined warfighters across multiple domains, according to Lt. Col. Taylor Francis, Director of Staff for the 4th Fighter Wing at Seymour Johnson AFB. 

This exercise and others like it help create multi-capable Airmen, which Gen. Charles Q. Brown, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, announced as a priority in his vision “Accelerate Change or Lose.” 

ACE training focuses on preparing Airmen for short or no-notice contingencies by having forces operate from locations with varying levels of capacity and support in a training environment.

This style of exercise also helps our units train to be strategically predictable, but operationally unpredictable, according to Wiederholt. Razor Talon helps the 305 AMW train with its joint partners to enhance passive and active defense capabilities while validating new and innovative ways to deploy and maneuver assets.

This year’s exercise involved participants from 19 different units across the Air Force, Army and Marine Corps. In total, Razor Talon featured 11 different mission design series and 145 total aircraft ranging from F-15Es and F-35Bs, to E-8Cs and HC-130Js. 

The 305th AMW KC-10s demonstrated the wing’s aerial refueling capabilities in a joint environment. However, for the first time ever, the Wing also demonstrated its capabilities to support operations in austere environments through the C-17, according to Capt. Trevor Leeming, a C-17A instructor pilot and the 305th AMW lead planner for the exercise.

“We provided the ability to actually complete the Agile Combat Employment concept with an integrated joint force,” Leeming added. “We allowed a further projection of force than previously attainable, with as few assets as possible to get the job done.”

The 305th AMW is expected to continue to participate in these exercises, further demonstrating its role in rapid global mobility and active role in a joint environment. 

“We’re excited to see these types of exercises develop as they continue to test and improve our Airmen and capabilities,” Wiederholt added. “We’re proud to participate and look forward to seeing the progress that will come as a result.”",2020/12/7,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/384443/305th-amw-supports-ace-exercise-razor-talon,"JOINT BASE MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST, NJ, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国新泽西州MCGUIRE-DIX-LAKEHURST联合基地,305AMW支持ACE训练剃须刀爪,12月1日至4日，在北卡罗来纳州西摩约翰逊空军基地，一架C-17 Globemaster III和四架KC-10扩展器从第305空中机动联队支援了“剃刀爪”多日演习。虽然KC-10自近十年前建立“剃刀爪”演习以来一直是该演习的参与者，但这是C-17首次参加。“第305航空机动性联队指挥官斯科特・维德霍尔特上校说：“第305航空机动性联队在“剃刀爪”等演习中的作用只是为了说明快速全球机动性对于空军和国防部的工作是多么重要。”。“我们通过燃料、货物、人员等实现空中和地面作战，为打击就业提供了稳定而坚实的支柱。”西摩约翰逊空军基地第四战斗机联队参谋长泰勒・弗朗西斯中校表示，Razor Talon是一项季度敏捷作战部署和大型部队综合训练演习，允许空军在充分发展的威胁情景环境中，与跨多个领域的联合和联合作战人员进行训练。这次演习和其他类似的演习有助于培养多才多艺的飞行员，空军参谋长查尔斯・Q・布朗上将在他的愿景中宣布，这是“加速变革或失败”的优先事项ACE训练的重点是通过让部队在训练环境中从不同能力和支持水平的地点作战，为飞行员在短时间或不通知的紧急情况下做好准备。Wiederholt说，这种演习方式还帮助我们的部队训练在战略上可预测，但在作战上不可预测。Razor Talon与联合伙伴一起帮助305 AMW训练提高被动和主动防御能力，同时验证部署和机动资产的新方法和创新方法。今年的演习包括来自空军、陆军和海军陆战队19个不同单位的参与者。总的来说，Razor Talon拥有11个不同的任务设计系列和145架飞机，从F-15Es和F-35Bs，到E-8Cs和HC-130Js。第305架AMW KC-10s展示了该联队在联合环境中的空中加油能力。然而，据C-17A教练飞行员、第305届AMW演习主要策划人特雷弗・利明上尉（Trevor Leeming）称，联队还首次通过C-17展示了其在严峻环境中支持作战的能力。Leeming补充道：“我们提供了通过一体化联合部队实际完成敏捷作战使用概念的能力。我们允许比以前更进一步的力量投射，用尽可能少的资产完成任务。”第305AMW预计将继续参加这些演习，进一步展示其在全球快速机动中的作用以及在联合环境中的积极作用。Wiederholt补充道：“我们很高兴看到这些类型的演习在不断测试和提高我们的飞行员和能力的同时得到发展。”。“我们很荣幸能够参与，并期待看到由此带来的进展。”
131,AETC general talks pilot training at Alamo ACE,"By David DeKunder | 502nd Air Base Wing Public Affairs
In order to maintain readiness, the Air Force is utilizing innovation and technology to transform pilot training to be faster while also teaching skills that will make effective warfighters, according to the Air National Guard assistant to the commander at Air Education and Training Command who spoke during this year’s Alamo Chapter of the Armed Forces Communications & Electronics Association virtual Alamo ACE conference Nov. 19. 

Maj. Gen. John Hronek discussed initiatives and programs AETC is implementing to transform pilot training, and he explained how technologies, including virtual reality, artificial intelligence and analytics, have important roles in how AETC instructors are training pilots.  

“As we recruit pilot candidates, we try to build the most diverse, best candidates we have out there, that really have the passion, that want to be part of the Air Force, and we are finding ways to do that better - getting the wings into the Air Force,” Hronek said.  

There are two main objectives in accomplishing the task of transforming pilot training, enhancing lethality and readiness, and transforming the way pilots learn, Hronek said.  

“Being lethal and ready requires the Air Force to have access to the latest technology for pilot training,” he said. “We have competition from the Russians and the Chinese, who have basically developed their technologies and their capabilities. We need to not only keep up with, but be ahead of them. That has been our greatest strength as Americans, as we’ve always been leaders in our technology. I think that’s something that we really need to work on within our future.” 

Another initiative to enhancing lethality and readiness is adjustable training timelines and modularized technical training techniques, which have cut idle time in certain training pipelines by 40 percent, enabling Airmen to get through training and to their first duty locations faster and more ready, he said.  

Hronek also discussed AETC’s Pilot Training Next initiative, which focuses on training pilots better and faster, while helping them foster deeper learning. This is based on utilizing advanced immersive training, remote simulator operations, and innovations in the advanced phases of pilot training by working with industry partners.  

Through the Pilot Training Next initiative, Hronek said AETC has been able to decrease some portions of pilot training by several months. 

“As we improved our effectiveness with what we’ve learned in our Pilot Training Next experiments since 2018, we are trying to operationalize the proven innovation concepts in the limited scale,” he said.  

“We want to transition to a student-centered learning, not just one class. We also want to deliver quality instruction that gives feedback to the instructors on how that student is progressing and how they can progress them faster, making sure they are not missing something,” Hronek said. “In order to accelerate change, we must embrace the pace of technology and change that which currently exists in our world.”",2020/11/23,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/383811/aetc-general-talks-pilot-training-alamo-ace,"SAN ANTONIO, TX, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国德克萨斯州圣安东尼奥,AETC通用讲座阿拉莫ACE飞行员培训,David DeKunder | 502空军基地联队公共事务为了保持战备状态，空军正在利用创新和技术将飞行员训练转变为更快的训练，同时教授能够培养高效作战人员的技能，据空军教育和训练司令部司令的空军国民警卫队助理说，他在今年11月19日举行的武装部队通信与电子协会阿拉莫分会虚拟阿拉莫ACE会议上发表了讲话。John Hronek少将讨论了AETC为改变飞行员培训而实施的举措和计划，并解释了包括虚拟现实、人工智能和分析在内的技术如何在AETC教员培训飞行员方面发挥重要作用。“在招募飞行员候选人的过程中，我们会努力培养出最多元化、最优秀的候选人，他们真正有激情，希望成为空军的一员，我们正在寻找更好的方法――让机翼进入空军，”赫勒克说。Hronek说，完成转变飞行员训练、提高杀伤力和战备能力以及转变飞行员学习方式的任务有两个主要目标。他说：“要想成为致命的、随时准备好的飞行员，美国空军必须能够获得最新的飞行员训练技术。”。“我们有来自俄罗斯和中国的竞争，他们基本上开发了他们的技术和能力。我们不仅要跟上他们，而且要走在他们前面。这是我们作为美国人最大的优势，因为我们一直是我们技术的领军者。我认为这是我们真正需要与我合作的事情。”他说：“提高杀伤力和战备能力的另一项举措是可调整的训练时间表和模块化的技术训练技术，这将某些训练管道中的空闲时间减少了40%，使飞行员能够更快、更充分地完成训练并到达首个执勤地点。”。Hronek还讨论了AETC的飞行员培训下一步计划，该计划侧重于更好更快地培训飞行员，同时帮助他们培养更深层次的学习。这是基于利用先进的沉浸式培训、远程模拟器操作，以及通过与行业合作伙伴合作在飞行员培训的高级阶段进行创新。Hronek说，通过飞行员培训下一步计划，AETC已经能够将飞行员培训的某些部分减少几个月。“自2018年以来，随着我们在试点培训下一个实验中所学到的知识提高了我们的效率，我们正试图在有限的规模内实施经验证的创新概念，”他说。“我们希望过渡到以学生为中心的学习，而不仅仅是一门课。我们还希望提供高质量的教学，向教师反馈学生的进步情况，以及他们如何更快地进步，确保他们不会遗漏什么，”Hronek说。“为了加速变革，我们必须跟上技术的步伐，改变当今世界的现状。”
132,337th ACS continues mission through COVID-19,"COVID-19 has brought many new challenges to units across the United States Air Force, but each unit has found ways to fight through while reducing the risk of exposure. For the 337th Air Control Squadron, Air Battle Managers have continued to train and graduate.

“We have continued to graduate students through our course as planned with class sizes of 8 students rather than 12, and we have implemented split operations for our squadron and students in order to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19,” said Senior Airman Jordyn Jones, 337th ACS weapons simulation technician.

In addition to reducing class sizes and separating operations, students from each team worked different days and hours and were not allowed to be in contact with any student from the other team.

“Face masks are required to be worn at all times and hand sanitizer is located at all entry points,” said Jones. “All briefings are either online or are held in the auditorium where they can maintain a six-foot distance between themselves.”

With these added measures, future Air Battle Managers can focus on training for the critical role they play in the operational Air Force.

“Air Battle Managers perform the tactical and operational command and control for the Combatant Commanders, said Maj. Michael Davis, 337th ACS director of operations. “Command and Control is a core mission for the USAF and battle management is a force multiplier in combat operations.” 

Maintaining mental fitness during COVID-19 has been a challenge and leaders across the Air Force are trying to find ways to help their Airmen.

“Teamwork is paramount to the command and control community, especially in the dynamic schoolhouse setting with an ever-changing and complex schedule,” said Davis. “Each Airmen helps their teammates out on the ops floors, classroom, and with life events, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.”

Supervisors from the 337th ACS made care packages for Airmen in the dorms, flight chiefs dropped off food for those who had to be in quarantine, and many Airmen received a personal call from the commander.

133,"4th SOS, AMU make history with AC-130U","HURLBURT FIELD, Fla. -- An AC-130U Spooky gunship named ‘Big Daddy’ made history by being the first Spooky to ever receive a black letter initial on its status page before a flight, June 18, 2020. 
	This was a momentous accomplishment for Air Commandos in the 4th Special Operations Squadron and the 4th AMU. 
“A black letter is significant because it means there are absolutely no discrepancies whatsoever on the plane,” said U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Mark Lennon, a section chief with the 4th Aircraft Maintenance Unit. “A black letter is when there’s no discrepancies on the status page. The crew chief’s last name and first initial goes in that place. It shows that aircraft has really been maintained with excellence.”
	This standard of excellence is only achieved through teamwork. 
	“It’s a huge teamwork effort and accomplishment for everyone,” said Lennon. “It takes a lot of hard work and pride to make this happen.”
	The last Spooky named ‘Gunslinger’ retired to the boneyard at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, June 26, 2020. However, Big Daddy will be the last to retire and will be placed in the Hurlburt Field Air Park.
	Any time an aircraft flies, it could come back with any number of discrepancies, or those discrepancies which can be found when maintainers do their inspections.
	“Aircraft across the Air Force usually fly with discrepancies, so it’s really rare to see a black letter initial,” said Lennon. “In my 11 years in service, I’ve only seen it one other time.”
	The Spookys have been operational since 1995, providing combat overwatch for 18 of those years. The heavily armed aircraft incorporates side-firing weapons integrated with sophisticated sensor, navigation, and fire control systems to provide surgical firepower or area saturation during extended loiter periods, at night and in adverse weather.
	The mission down range has been taken over by the AC-130J Ghostrider gunships since July 2019. The same aircraft the 4th SOS and AMU will now be working with.
	“After 25 years of service, we’re closing one chapter and starting another with the AC-130Js,” said U.S. Air Force Capt. Hannah Boeman, officer in charge with the 4th AMU. “Talking to a lot of the maintainers at the 4th AMU, it’s kind of a bittersweet moment for them. Since most of them have spent a majority of their career working with these aircraft, I know it’s sad to see them go.”",2020/6/26,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/372961/4th-sos-amu-make-history-with-ac-130u,"HURLBURT FIELD, FL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佛罗里达州赫尔伯特菲尔德,第四个SOS，AMU用AC-130U创造历史,佛罗里达州赫尔伯特菲尔德――2020年6月18日，一艘名为“大爸爸”的AC-130U恐怖武装直升机创造了历史，它是第一艘在飞行前状态页面上收到黑色字母首字母的恐怖飞机。这是第四特种作战中队和第四陆军军事大学空中突击队的一项重大成就。美国空军技术中士马克・列侬（Mark Lennon）是第四飞机维修队的一名科长，他说：“黑色字母很重要，因为它意味着飞机上绝对没有任何差异。”。“黑色字母是指状态页面上没有差异。机组长的姓氏和首字母都在该位置。这表明飞机的维护非常出色。”这一卓越标准只有通过团队合作才能实现。列侬说：“这对每个人来说都是巨大的团队合作和成就。”。“实现这一目标需要付出大量的努力和骄傲。”最后一位名叫“枪手”的恐怖分子于2020年6月26日在亚利桑那州戴维斯-蒙坦空军基地的墓地退休。然而，“大爸爸”将是最后一个退休的，并将被安置在赫尔伯特机场的空中公园。任何时候，飞机飞回来时，都可能出现任何数量的差异，或者在维修人员进行检查时发现的差异。列侬说：“空军的飞机通常飞行时会有不一致之处，所以很少看到黑色字母的首字母。在我11年的服役中，我只见过一次。”幽灵战机自1995年开始运作，其中18年提供战斗警戒。全副武装的飞机采用侧射武器，集成了先进的传感器、导航和火控系统，在夜间和恶劣天气下长时间游荡期间提供外科手术火力或区域饱和自2019年7月以来，AC-130J Ghostrider武装直升机已经接管了任务下射程。第四SOS和AMU现在将使用同一架飞机。“在服役25年后，我们将以AC-130Js结束一个章节，并开始另一个章节，”美国空军上尉、第四AMU负责人汉娜・博曼（Hannah Boeman）说。“与第四航空管理大学的许多维修人员交谈，这对他们来说是一个苦乐参半的时刻。因为他们中的大多数人在职业生涯的大部分时间里都在与这些飞机一起工作，我知道看到他们离去是很悲哀的。”
134,Call of Support- ACS reaches out to Bragg residents,"FORT BRAGG, N.C. - Face coverings. Pandemic. Social distancing. A few months ago these were all foreign ideas and terms to most people. Today, they are all too familiar in our everyday lives. As we adjusted the way we lived our lives, we also had to adjust how we communicate and interact with each other. Fort Bragg’s Army Community Service was no exception. They needed to find a way to continue to communicate and help their customers.

The decision was made for ACS staff to call on-post residents to reach out to our soldiers and Families, connect them with resources, and to let them know assistance is always available, if and when needed. 

Staff members making the calls were asked to come into the office to do so. Since the ACS offices were closed to the public, this allowed employees to maintain safety and social distancing. An added benefit of having staff members come into the office for the calls, was the ability to check in and check on each other, giving managers some face time to ensure staff members were doing well and staying healthy.

“Due to a lot of our employees not having government phones, we asked for staff to voluntarily come in and assist with the calls,” said Barbara Trower-Simpkins, ACS Director. “Employees thought this was a great opportunity to expose more families to ACS services, especially those who might possibly be in crisis mode, due to the circumstances.”

Simpkins added approximately 50 of their 88 staff members came in to help every Thursday and Friday. Those who had government phones assisted off-site. Additionally, program managers with government phones came in to work right along with their employees.

 “Our number one priority was to ensure that all staff were safe upon entering the building,” Simpkins said. “We required a face mask and ensured that each person had their own space to make calls.  Not only did our government employees assist, but our contracting teams in Family Advocacy, Exceptional Family Member program and Relocation came in to help with the calls.  Everyone saw this as a great opportunity to assist our Families with resources and services that they may need during this unprecedented time.”

Phone calls were made over a five-week period. Each household received one call per week, reaching 4,273 on-post residents at least once. An average of 900 messages were left each week for residents. The messages let residents know where and how to reach out for help. 

ACS employees were provided with a script to help ensure the same message was being presented during each phone call.  Many of those being called had questions beyond the scope of ACS services; such as, where the COVID-19 screening locations were, where to find updates on installation facilities, and the Womack Army Medical Center Nurse Advice Line. In addition, Families that were not aware of the services ACS provided now had a one-on-one opportunity to ask questions and receive an answer from an expert. 

The phone calls came as a surprise to some residents that ACS and installation leaders would take the time to call and check on their wellbeing. Residents were connected with necessary resources, and ACS contact information was provided, in case they needed something or had more questions. During this unsure time, Families were left with a sense of security knowing they had someone to reach out to no matter their need.

“Residents largely welcomed the calls, appreciating that someone cared to check on them and offer assistance during this uncertain and stressful time,” said Audra Satterlee, ACS Specialist. “There was an impressively warm reception to the weekly calls. Because we ended up calling weekly, ACS staff members were even able to follow up on some of the questions asked and information provided from previous calls.”

Overall, most residents appreciated the welfare calls. However, some were not as receptive to the phone calls. Since the calls were unannounced, some Families were not sure if they were receiving a scam phone call or not. Additionally, others felt the questions about recent travel and recent health issues were an invasion of privacy and chose to not answer the questions. Hang-ups and blocking ACS phone numbers happened as well.

Although tedious during chaotic times, the phone calls produced positive interactions and exposure for Fort Bragg’s Army Community Service. 

“Some Families do not have a support network in the area,” Satterlee said. “Some had just arrived to the area. Some just had new babies and were basically on their own during the stay-at-home order. So to be able to engage with those Families and help ensure they were managing the new norm in a positive way was imperative to us. They might not have otherwise reached out to anyone for support.”

As we continue to navigate through our new normal in a COVID-19 world, it is important to remember that something as simple as a phone call can make an impact on the lives around us.",2020/6/8,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/371744/call-support-acs-reaches-out-bragg-residents,"FORT BRAGG, NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国北卡罗来纳州布拉格堡,支持呼吁-ACS联系布拉格居民,北卡罗来纳州布拉格堡-面部覆盖物。流行病社交距离。几个月前，对大多数人来说，这些都是外来的想法和术语。今天，他们在我们的日常生活中都太熟悉了。当我们调整我们的生活方式时，我们也必须调整我们彼此沟通和互动的方式。布拉格堡的军队社区服务也不例外。他们需要找到一种方式来继续沟通和帮助他们的客户。ACS的工作人员决定呼吁派驻人员与我们的士兵和家属联系，向他们提供资源，并让他们知道，如果需要，随时都可以提供援助。打电话的工作人员被要求进入办公室。由于ACS办公室对公众关闭，这使得员工能够保持安全和社交距离。让员工到办公室接电话的另一个好处是，他们可以登记入住并互相检查，给经理们一些面对面的时间，以确保员工身体健康。ACS主管芭芭拉・特罗威尔・辛普金斯（Barbara Trower Simpkins）说：“由于我们的许多员工没有政府电话，我们要求员工自愿来协助接听电话。”。“员工们认为这是一个让更多家庭接触ACS服务的绝佳机会，尤其是那些由于环境原因可能处于危机状态的家庭。”辛普金斯补充说，他们的88名员工中约有50人每周四和周五都会来帮忙。那些使用政府电话的员工在场外得到帮助。此外，使用政府电话的项目经理也会直接与员工一起工作。“我们的首要任务是确保所有员工进入大楼时都是安全的。”辛普金斯说。“我们需要一个面罩，并确保每个人都有自己的空间打电话。不仅我们的政府雇员提供了帮助，而且我们在家庭倡导、特殊家庭成员计划和搬迁方面的合同团队也来帮助打电话。每个人都认为这是一个利用资源和资源帮助我们家庭的绝佳机会他们在这前所未有的时期可能需要的服务。”电话通话持续了五周。每家每户每周都会接到一个电话，至少一次到达4273个居民邮箱。平均每周给居民留下900条信息。这些信息让居民知道在哪里以及如何寻求帮助。ACS员工被提供了一个脚本，以帮助确保同样的信息被发送出去ing在每次通话中都会出现。许多被呼叫者的问题超出了ACS服务的范围；例如，新冠病毒-19筛查地点在哪里，在哪里可以找到安装设施的更新，以及沃马克陆军医疗中心护士咨询热线。此外，不知道ACS提供服务的家庭现在已经知道了d一对一的提问机会，并从专家那里得到答案。这些电话让一些居民感到意外，因为ACS和安装领导会花时间打电话检查他们的健康状况。居民们与必要的资源联系，并提供ACS联系信息，以防他们需要什么或者有更多的问题。在这段不确定的时间里，家人都有一种安全感，他们知道无论需要什么都有人可以联系。“居民们基本上欢迎这些电话，感谢有人在这段不确定和紧张的时间里关心他们并提供帮助，”ACS专家Audra Satterlee说。“每周电话都受到了令人印象深刻的热情接待。因为我们最终每周都会打电话，ACS的工作人员甚至能够跟进之前电话中提出的一些问题和提供的信息。”总的来说，大多数居民都很欣赏这些福利电话。然而，一些居民对这些电话不太愿意接受。由于这些电话是未经通知的，一些家庭不确定他们是否收到了诈骗电话。此外，其他人认为有关最近的旅行和最近的健康问题是对隐私的侵犯，因此选择了nT回答问题。挂断电话和封锁ACS电话号码也发生了。虽然在混乱时期很乏味，但这些电话为布拉格堡的军队社区服务带来了积极的互动和曝光。“一些家庭在该地区没有支持网络，”Satterlee说。“一些人刚到该地区。一些人刚生了婴儿，在家庭生活期间基本上是自己一个人。因此，能够与这些家庭接触并帮助确保他们以积极的方式管理新规范对我们来说至关重要。否则，他们可能不会向任何人寻求支持。”当我们在一个新的世界中继续探索新的常态时，重要的是要记住，像电话这样简单的事情可以对我们周围的生活产生影响。

136,726th ACS commander and spouse renovate mothers’ room,"Often times, the achievement of military members are held in high regards, while the actions of their spouses are seen as the support of their greatness. Some stand out though, and find their own greatness in the support of their military partners, and the units they belong to.

Lt. Col. Richard Barber, 726th Air Control Squadron commander, and his wife, Kath Barber, provide an example of initiative by renovating the ACS mothers’ room, Sept. 20 2019. 

The new additions were made possible due to the Barbers’ donations, and most of the work was done by Kath herself. 

 ""We funded it completely,” Kath said. “I probably spent a little more than most would, but it doesn’t have to be expensive to be nice, it just needs a few touches to make it more personal.”

The changes include painting the walls, bringing in various sanitation items and a donated couch adding to the overall comfort of ACS mothers.

“We really didn’t want it to feel like a sterile Air Force room,” Kath said. “The less stressed a mother is the better she can express breast milk. I collectively pumped and breastfed for four and a half years, so I know how hard it is.”

The renovations fall in line with the recent update to Air Force Guidance Memorandum 2019-36-02, though Kath stated she wanted to do more for ACS moms.

""When I was pumping for my first kid, it was just a back office - it felt really awkward,"" said Staff Sgt. Tawnee Ash, 726th ACS quality assurance evaluator. ""[The mothers’ room] is wonderful. It feels like home here and not like I’m pumping at work.""

The Barbers wanted to support their working moms by providing a stress-free environment to pump and feel comfortable.

“It is Air Force regulation that every squadron has a mothers’ room, but there are no guidelines further than a comfortable chair, a hard surface and a lock on the door,” Kath said. “We decided to take it up a notch.”

People like the Barber family help improve the lives of base personnel by making changes themselves.

137,729th ACS enhance readiness with Raging Bull Exercise,"-- During the month of September, the 729th Air Control Squadron participated in Raging Bull, the unit’s largest exercise of the year. Airmen from the squadron convoyed from Hill Air Force Base to historic Wendover Airfield located in Utah’s western desert.

At Wendover, Airmen from 729th ACS set up a remote radar site, extending the unit’s abili9ty to control aircraft beyond the limitations of using a single location. In addition, a center and reporting contingent was setup within their compound back at Hill AFB that was staffed by several hundred personnel from various career fields. 

In addition to setting up a remote radar site, the squadron set up a campsite and established services such as power and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning to exercise for future deployments.

“These are an amazing group of Airmen,” said 2nd Lt. Jaceson Powell. “They came out here with operation goal of getting the site set up in 72 hours and they did it in 48 hours.”

During the exercise, the Airmen realistic readiness training. The squadron participate in multiple chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear scenarios, along with anti-terrorism and force protection responses, as well as medical training in self-aid buddy care.

Readiness exercises such as Raging Bull prepare the 729th ACS a meet a potential world-wide tasking at any given time.

“Our mission is to deploy on short notice to anywhere in the world and provide combatant commanders with persistent 24/7 battle management command and control of joint air operations,” said Lt. Col. Jeffrey Digsby, 729th ACS commander. 

The 729th ACS provides the theater Air Force commander a rapid reaction mobile air control system and control and reporting center during worldwide contingencies.

138,Surface Combat Systems Courses Recommended for ACE Accreditation,"Dahlgren, Va. C The Center for Surface Combat Systems (CSCS) recently announced that the American Council on Education (ACE), an academic accreditation agency, has recommended college credit for over 660 surface combat systems courses.

A team of academic experts in May evaluated five ratings; Fire Controlman (FC), Gunner's Mate (GM), Interior Communications Electrician (IC), and Sonar Technician (Surface) (STG), which were approaching academic expiration, and Fire Controlman Aegis (FCA), which was gaining college credits for the first time.

“The purpose was to determine whether a given military occupation contains the type of knowledge and skills that would be comparable to learning acquired in college-level courses,” explained Ms. Nadine Galazka, CSCS’ ACE program manager.  “The academia subject matter experts interviewed Sailors from our sites and dets, who assembled at CSCS Det East, and conducted interviews via teleconference.  The discussions focused on responsibilities, functions, duties, and skills of the job.”

Other commands and ships were involved in this vital effort as well, including Commander, Naval Surface Force, Atlantic; Commander, U.S. 3rd Fleet; Commander, Destroyer Squadron 22; Naval Sea Systems Command’s Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion, and repair; Afloat Training Group, Norfolk; Naval Air Station Patuxent River; Naval Station Norfolk Air Operations; Mid Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center; Navy Supply Fleet Logistics Center; Afloat Media Systems; USS Arleigh Burke (DDG 51); USS Cole (DDG 67); USS Oscar Austin (DDG 79); USS Winston S. Churchill (DDG 81); PCU Delbert D. Black (DDG 119); USS Normandy (CG 60); USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77); and USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78).  

“The advantage of this accreditation is that many service members and veterans have been able to receive recommended credit at a college or university,” Galazka explained.  “At approximately 500 dollars per credit, it is about a 331,000 dollars savings for Sailors seeking degrees.” 

The ACE evaluation provides recommendations only and therefore, Sailors should visit a local Navy College Office to determine if the credits will be accepted at the college or university of their choice.

""The expertise of the surface combat systems community played a vital role in receiving these college, recommended credit hours for our students,"" Galazka said.  ""As a global, educational institution, CSCS strives each day to provide the tools that Sailors need to excel not only in the fleet, but in society as a whole.”

CSCS' mission is to develop and deliver surface ship combat systems training to achieve surface warfare superiority. CSCS headquarters' staff oversees 14 learning sites and detachments located throughout the continental United States, Hawaii, and Japan and manages and operates a Naval Education and Training Command (NETC) training division in Rota, Spain.  CSCS provides over 538 courses, awards 114 different Navy Enlisted Classifications (NECs), and trains over 38,000 Sailors a year.  CSCS delivers specialized training for Officer and Enlisted Sailors to tactically operate, maintain, and employ shipboard and shore-based weapons, sensors, and command and control systems utilized in today's Navy.

139,"Video chat technology transforms ACS, fosters readiness","The Army Community Services (ACS) lifeline between Tobyhanna Army Depot and Picatinny Arsenal, New Jersey, went live earlier this summer rebooting a series of programs lost to budget cuts in 2017.

The inventive workaround, developed by depot experts, gives eligible personnel stationed at Picatinny easy access to services more than a year after Army ACS ceased operations. Point to point video chat technology is making it possible for military and family members to meet face-to-face with ACS program managers at Tobyhanna, though miles separate them.
 
“It’s often the emotionally charged situation that causes an individual to reach out to ACS for assistance,” said Andrew Ciccolella, Picatinny Morale, Welfare and Recreation director.  “There is something so personal about a video call versus a phone call.  Callers can see they have the manager’s undivided attention and are able to put a face to the name.”

In a few minutes, customers can live chat with a subject matter expert at Tobyhanna by following easy to understand prompts on a computer monitor. The non-CAC (common access card) enabled system in the Picatinny ACS office is connected to three workstations in the Installation Services Directorate’s Army Community Services Branch. The plan is to have the entire staff equipped to support the new way of doing business by 2020. 

“Soldiers and their families are going to find this new way of doing things very helpful,” said Staff Sgt. Edward Morris, religious affairs noncommissioned officer at Picatinny. “Spouses who don’t have common access cards no longer need to rely on the service member to take advantage of the various ACS programs. This is significant, especially when a Soldier deploys.”  

Picatinny and Tobyhanna officials were able to restore ACS programs at the arsenal by implementing a hub and spoke type of network last year. Operating as a regional hub, Tobyhanna helped Picatinny expand their support services from one-day-a-week visits conducted by a depot staff member to a functional, on-site office featuring state-of-the-art equipment and staffed with an ACS specialist. 

ACS Specialist Isabelle Yaroch makes sure necessary documents are available, directs customers to the right people, and schedules meetings or classes. She also oversees the volunteer program for Tobyhanna and Picatinny.  

“I’m thrilled to be a part of this new way of doing business,” Yaroch said.  “My job is to take care of the community, so the warfighter can focus on the mission.”

The idea to leverage technology was born from a desire to improve the quality of life for military members and their families.  The ability to video chat with trained professionals who are miles away is just the first step toward creating a new normal for the Army’s ACS mission. 

Plans for this technology includes offering virtual training classes on how to write a resume, apply for a government job or manage personal finances.  All classes offered at Tobyhanna will be taught at Picatinny once the capability is developed, according to Lisa Crews, Army Community Services Branch chief at Tobyhanna.  

“It’s possible to build on the hub and spoke network by partnering with other installations facing the same issues as Picatinny,” Crews said. “Picatinny and Tobyhanna were successful because of the strength of teamwork.”",2019/7/16,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/331638/video-chat-technology-transforms-acs-fosters-readiness,"PA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国宾夕法尼亚州,视频聊天技术改变了ACS，提高了准备能力,今年夏天早些时候，位于新泽西州Tobyhanna陆军基地和Picatinny兵工厂之间的陆军社区服务（ACS）生命线上线，重新启动了2017年因预算削减而失败的一系列计划。由基地专家开发的创新解决方案，在陆军ACS停止运作一年多后，使驻扎在皮卡汀尼的合格人员能够轻松获得服务。点对点视频聊天技术使军人和家庭成员能够在Tobyhanna与ACS项目经理面对面会面，尽管miles将他们分开。“通常是情绪激动的情况导致个人向ACS寻求帮助，”Picatinny Taila的Andrew Ciccolela说，福利及康乐事务署署长。“视频通话与电话通话相比，有着非常私人的一面。打电话的人可以看到他们得到了经理的全神贯注，并且能够给名字贴上一张脸。”几分钟后，客户可以按照计算机显示器上易于理解的提示，与Tobyhanna的主题专家进行实时聊天。Picatinny ACS办公室的非CAC（公共访问卡）启用系统连接到安装服务董事会陆军社区服务处的三个工作站。该计划是到2020年，让全体员工都能支持新的经营方式。“士兵和他们的家人会发现这种新的做事方式非常有帮助，”皮卡廷尼宗教事务士官爱德华・莫里斯上士说。“没有公共访问卡的配偶不再需要依靠服役人员来利用各种ACS计划。这一点非常重要，尤其是当士兵部署时。”Picatinny和Tobyhanna官员去年通过实施一种中心辐射式网络，得以恢复兵工厂的ACS计划。作为一个区域中心，Tobyhanna帮助Picatinny将其支持服务从一名仓库工作人员每周一天的访问扩展到一个功能齐全的现场办公室，该办公室配备最先进的设备和ACS专家。ACS专家Isabelle Yaroch确保提供必要的文件，指导客户找到合适的人，安排会议或课程。她还负责监督托比安娜和皮卡汀尼的志愿者项目。“我很高兴能成为这种新的商业方式的一部分，”Yaroch说。“我的工作是照顾社区，让战士能够专注于任务。”利用技术的想法诞生于改善军人及其家庭生活质量的愿望。能够与数英里外训练有素的专业人员视频聊天只是为陆军ACS任务创造新常态的第一步。这项技术的计划包括提供虚拟培训课程，内容包括如何撰写简历、申请政府职位或管理个人财务。托比汉纳陆军社区服务处处长丽莎・克鲁斯（Lisa Crews）表示，一旦能力得到发展，托比汉纳提供的所有课程都将在皮卡汀尼授课。克鲁斯说：“通过与面临与皮卡汀尼相同问题的其他装置合作，可以在中心辐射网络上进行建设。”。“Picatinny和Tobyhanna的成功是因为团队合作的力量。”
140,607th ACS all female mission makes history,"For the first time in Air Force history, the Command and Control Battle Management Operations career field executed a mission on its newest weapon system, the Battlefield Control System, with an entirely female crew. From scheduling and mission planning to communications equipment set up and maintenance, a full crew of women from the 607th Air Control Squadron at Luke Air Force Base left their mark on history. 

The 607 ACS is a schoolhouse tasked with developing the future of command and control, one Airman at a time. They are responsible for seven different courses ranging from the initial Surveillance Technician course for recent graduates of their preliminary technical training to the Undergraduate Weapons Director course, teaching Airman aerial engagement and combat weapon system employment and management tactics. Normally, at any given time, there are nearly 80 Airmen in training at the 607 ACS. 

“We teach our students how to interpret radar data and make sure that we are controlling the battle and keeping our pilots as safe as possible in what are usually the busiest air spaces in the world when we deploy,” said Master Sgt. Summer Chenault, 607th Air Control Squadron Alpha Flight Chief. 

Mission planning is an all-day event and starts the day before the mission. The team uses intelligence gathered to plan a war-time battle management scenario from beginning to end. They look at types of friendly and enemy aircraft anticipated, how many air bases are in the area, political borders and what they can expect from each crew member. 

“It is very detailed because if you don’t understand what you’re doing when you step out there, then you’re not going to understand what you should be doing while you’re performing the mission,” Chenault said.

With 18 members involved in the mission in some way and in an operations environment that has traditionally been male dominated, the opportunity to conduct a mission with this type of crew had never presented itself on this weapon system.  

“In such a small career field with very few women and even fewer in weapons controller positions, it’s been difficult to accomplish a mission like this,” said Staff Sgt. Amber Hoedebeck, 607 ACS Weapons Director Initial Qualification Training course manager. “To look across the board and see all of my mentors and peers that I am working with and to see that they are females, there is nothing greater in a day like today.” 

Although the mission itself was conducted by an entirely female crew, the excitement was felt throughout the 607 ACS.

“Our leadership team and everyone else were very supportive,” said Chenault.  “We are a family and they looked at it as ‘heck yeah’ and thought it was awesome that we were out there doing this.” 

Whether it’s carrying out an all-female mission or any daily mission, the instructor cadre aims to inspire and takes pride in sending the best trained Command and Control Battle Managers out into the combat Air Forces. 

“There is nothing like it,” said Chenault. “I get emotional because I am so proud of what we do. It’s incredible to watch them from start to finish, and I know when they leave here with the training they’ve received, the future of our career field is in safe hands.”",2019/4/1,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/316503/607th-acs-all-female-mission-makes-history,"LUKE AIR FORCE BASE, AZ, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国亚利桑那州卢克空军基地,第607届ACS全女性使命创造历史,在空军历史上，指挥与控制作战管理职业领域首次在其最新的武器系统――战场控制系统上执行任务，全体机组人员为女性。从日程安排和任务规划到通信设备的安装和维护，来自卢克空军基地第607空中控制中队的全体女性机组人员在历史上留下了他们的印记。607ACS是一所学校，负责开发未来的指挥和控制，一次一名飞行员。他们负责七门不同的课程，从初级技术培训的应届毕业生的初级监视技术员课程到本科武器主管课程，教授飞行员空中交战和作战武器系统使用和管理战术。通常，在任何特定时间，都有近80名飞行员在607 ACS接受训练。“我们教我们的学生如何解读雷达数据，确保我们在部署时能够控制战斗，并在通常是世界上最繁忙的空域尽可能保证我们的飞行员的安全，”第607空中控制中队阿尔法飞行负责人萨默特・切诺上士说。任务规划是一项全天活动，从任务开始的前一天开始。该团队利用收集到的情报从头至尾规划战时作战管理场景。他们研究了预计的敌友飞机类型、该地区有多少空军基地、政治边界以及他们对每个机组成员的期望。Chenault说：“这是非常详细的，因为如果你不明白你在那里做什么，那么你就不会明白你在执行任务时应该做什么。”有18名成员以某种方式参与了任务，而且在一个传统上以男性为主的作战环境中，在这种武器系统上，从未出现过用这种类型的乘员执行任务的机会。607 ACS武器总监初始资格培训课程经理、参谋中士Amber Hoedebeck说：“在这样一个职业领域，女性人数很少，担任武器控制员职位的女性更少，很难完成这样的任务。”。“放眼全局，看看我所有的导师和同事，看看他们都是女性，在今天这样的日子里，没有什么比这更伟大的了。”虽然任务本身是由一个完全由女性船员执行的，但整个607 ACS都感受到了兴奋。“我们的领导团队和所有其他人都非常支持。”切诺说。“我们是一家人，他们认为这是‘见鬼，是的’，并认为我们在那里做这件事太棒了。”无论是执行全女性任务还是任何日常任务，教练干部都旨在激励并自豪地将训练有素的指挥和控制战斗管理人员派遣到作战空军。“没有比这更好的了，”切诺说。“我很激动，因为我为我们所做的感到骄傲。从开始到结束都能看到他们，这是难以置信的。我知道，当他们带着接受的训练离开这里时，我们职业领域的未来就在安全的手中。”
141,Top Secret- The Forgotten Fighter Ace of the Korean War,"Retired Navy Capt. E. Royce Williams has been keeping a secret for more than 50 years. 
To his friends, family, and others he served with, Williams was known as a decorated fighter pilot, who led a successful career in the Navy, where he served for more than 30 years and flew more than 220 missions in Korea and Vietnam. However, even his wife wasn’t aware of what he’d done on Nov. 18, 1952. 
That morning, Williams was continuing what had become a daily routine for him as a young Navy pilot stationed onboard the USS Oriskany off the coast of Korea during the Korean War; flying his F9F-5 Panther fighter aircraft over the skies of North Korea to attack targets in support of operations on the ground. On this particular morning, the only difference was the targets were further north than usual C close to the country’s border with the Soviet Union. 
Despite a blizzard sweeping in with heavy winds and snow, Williams said the mission began successfully, with minor amounts of anti-aircraft fire. However, they hadn’t counted on the nearby Soviet base to notice their presence. Within minutes, the Soviets went to general quarters and scrambled seven MiG-15 fighters to react to the situation. 
“Our combat information center notified us that there were inbound bogeys,” said Williams. “I spotted seven contrails coming from the north, and identified them as MiGs.”
Once the MiGs passed over Williams and his wingman, they circled around and split into two groups C four to the right, and three to the left. Williams lost sight of the aircraft, and was ordered to move closer to the strike group to protect it in case the Soviets attacked. 
That’s when they dropped back in on Williams. 
“They dropped back in and started shooting,” said Williams. “Since they started the fight, I shot back.”
Williams quickly locked on to one of the aircraft and hit it, watching as it caught fire and billowed smoke on its way down. His wingman followed it, leaving Williams alone with the remaining MiGs. 
In another intense moment, Williams was able to dodge the weapons fire and shoot back, downing another MiG, leaving two of the original four in the fight. 
“I’m on the defensive C I’m not really declaring war on them,” said Williams. 
As he kept maneuvering to avoid being hit by the hundreds of bullets being fired, one of the Soviet pilots made a grave mistake, putting his aircraft directly in Williams’ sights. He took the opportunity and opened fire, downing a third MiG. 
On another turn, Williams felt his aircraft shake violently as it was hit by a MiG’s 37mm cannon C ripping holes in his fuselage and exploding, leaving his aircraft severely damaged. 
As he struggles to stay in the fight, something else goes wrong C Williams runs out of ammunition. 
The remaining MiGs followed Williams as he turned his damaged aircraft into the storm, using the high winds to shield himself from the incoming rounds as he headed full speed back towards his task force. 
“I could see the bullets coming over me, and under me,” said Williams. 
As he approached the task force, the remaining MiGs quickly retreated, assuming Williams probably wouldn’t make it back to the Oriskany due to severe damage regardless. Williams knew if he ejected, he’d end up freezing to death before he could be rescued, and his communications were now severed due to the damage done to his aircraft. He had no choice but to attempt a landing. 
To make matters worse, the task force had gone to general quarters with orders to open fire on any unidentified aircraft; since Williams couldn’t communicate with them, they opened fire on his aircraft C luckily stopping once he got close enough to identify. 
His Panther was unable to slow down or it would stall, which forced Williams to make his landing at 200 miles per hour. Somehow, he was still able to catch a wire on the flight deck and emerged unscathed. 
The next day, the crew inspected his Panther and found 263 holes in the aircraft. 
“You’d be surprised, it was almost like a training mission,” said Williams, recounting the story. “I was pretty stable.”
Soon after returning, Williams was ordered into a meeting with his Admiral and a representative of a brand new government agency C the National Security Agency. The NSA had been testing new communications equipment that was intercepting radio chatter from the Soviets, and they knew if any details from Williams’ mission went public, the Soviets would know the United States could hear their communications. Therefore, Williams was ordered not to tell a soul about his mission C it was classified as Top Secret. 
For the rest of his accomplished Navy career, and for decades after retirement, the details of Williams’ dogfight with Soviet MiGs over North Korea remained a secret. When he was finally contacted by the government and told his mission was declassified, the first person Williams said he told was his wife.",2018/12/1,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/304237/top-secret-forgotten-fighter-ace-korean-war,"CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],加利福尼亚州，美国,绝密-被遗忘的朝鲜战争王牌,退休的海军上校E・罗伊斯・威廉姆斯（E.Royce Williams）已经保守秘密50多年了。对他的朋友、家人和其他同事来说，威廉姆斯是一位被授予勋章的战斗机飞行员，他在海军服役30多年，在韩国和越南执行了220多项任务，并取得了成功。然而，就连他的妻子也不知道他在1952年11月18日做了什么。那天早上，威廉姆斯继续着他在朝鲜战争期间作为一名年轻的海军飞行员在朝鲜海岸外的奥里斯卡尼号上的日常生活；驾驶他的F9F-5黑豹战斗机在朝鲜上空攻击目标，以支持地面行动。在这个特殊的早晨，唯一的区别是目标比平时更北――靠近该国与苏联的边界。威廉姆斯说，尽管暴风雪伴随着大风和大雪席卷而来，但任务成功开始，只进行了少量的防空火力。然而，他们没有指望附近的苏联基地会注意到他们的存在。几分钟后，苏联人前往总司令部，紧急派出7架米格-15战斗机对局势作出反应。威廉姆斯说：“我们的作战信息中心通知我们有入境的转向架。”。“我发现了七条从北方飞来的轨迹，并确认它们是米格。”一旦米格飞过威廉姆斯和他的僚机，它们就盘旋并分成两组――四组在右边，三组在左边。威廉姆斯失去了飞机的视线，并被命令向攻击群靠近，以防苏联袭击。就在那时，他们又拜访了威廉姆斯。威廉姆斯说：“他们回来后开始射击。”。威廉姆斯迅速锁定其中一架飞机并将其击落，看着飞机着火并在降落过程中冒出滚滚浓烟。他的僚机尾随其后，留下威廉姆斯一人和其余的米格。在另一个紧张的时刻，威廉姆斯躲过了武器的火力并进行了反击，击落了另一架米格，留下了最初四架中的两架。威廉姆斯说：“我处于守势――我并不是真的向他们宣战。”。当他继续机动以避免被数百发子弹击中时，一名苏联飞行员犯了一个严重错误，把他的飞机直接放在威廉姆斯的视线中。他抓住机会开火，击落了第三架米格。在另一个转弯处，威廉姆斯感觉到他的飞机被米格37毫米加农炮击中时剧烈摇晃――撕裂机身上的孔并爆炸，使他的飞机严重受损。当他挣扎着要留在战斗中时，另一件事出了问题――威廉姆斯的弹药耗尽了。其余的MIG跟随威廉姆斯，他将损坏的飞机转入风暴，在全速返回特遣部队时，利用大风保护自己不受来袭炮弹的影响。威廉姆斯说：“我可以看到子弹从我身上、身下飞过。”。当他接近特遣部队时，剩余的米格战斗机迅速撤退，假设威廉姆斯可能因为严重的破坏而无法返回奥里斯坎尼号。威廉姆斯知道，如果他弹射，在获救之前，他将被冻死，他的通讯现在由于飞机受损而中断。他别无选择，只好尝试着陆。更糟糕的是，特遣部队已前往总部，下令向任何身份不明的飞机开火；由于威廉姆斯无法与他们沟通，他们向他的飞机开火――幸运的是，一旦他靠近并确认身份，飞机就停了下来。他的黑豹无法减速或失速，这迫使威廉姆斯以每小时200英里的速度着陆。不知何故，他仍然能够抓住飞行甲板上的一根电线，毫发无损地走了出来。第二天，机组人员检查了他的黑豹，发现飞机上有263个洞。威廉姆斯在讲述故事时说：“你会感到惊讶，这几乎像是一次训练任务。”。“我很稳定。”返回后不久，威廉姆斯奉命与他的海军上将以及一个全新的政府机构――国家安全局的代表会面。美国国家安全局一直在测试新的通讯设备，以拦截来自苏联的无线电聊天，他们知道如果威廉姆斯任务的任何细节公开，苏联人就会知道美国可以听到他们的通讯。因此，威廉姆斯被命令不要告诉任何人他的任务――这被列为绝密。在他成功的海军生涯的剩余时间里，以及退休后的几十年里，威廉姆斯与苏联米格在朝鲜问题上的混战细节一直是个秘密。当政府最终联系到他并告知他的任务已经解密时，威廉姆斯说他告诉的第一个人是他的妻子。
142,"SMDC builds, tests satellite components with ACES RED","REDSTONE ARSENAL, Alabama C When dealing with the future of Army satellite technologies, SMDC keeps its ACES RED.

The Army Cost Efficient Spaceflight Research Experiments and Demonstrations, or ACES RED, is a U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command technology demonstration for small satellites in support of Army and command technical objectives with support from Radiance Technologies and the University of Alabama in Huntsville, or UAH, System Management and Production Center.

ACES RED was developed in the USASMDC/ARSTRAT Technical Center’s Concepts Analysis Laboratory, or CAL. The CAL brings together high school and college students, under the supervision and mentorship of SMDC Tech Center government employees, to perform hands-on tasks for government projects and SMDC research.

“ACES RED is built to increase the technology readiness level of different components for flight-based missions for other programs within the command,” said Mason Nixon, ACES RED principle investigator. “We are taking different technologies and trying to advance them while reducing risks so other programs don’t have to. We also want to train the incoming workforce and build up technical competencies in those core areas that support our missions.”

This experiment looks to quickly mature various commercially available off-the-shelf technologies that will reduce the cost and complexity as well as maintain the performance of future Army small satellites.

Its main technical goal is to solve vectoring problem solutions by implementing multiple sensors in various combinations or configurations. ACES RED’s secondary objectives include maturation of non-traditional and commercial off-the-shelf, or COTS, industrial-grade components in the place of traditionally hardened and more expensive space systems, such as flight computers, memory devices, imaging sensors and attitude determination devices.

“We are also using ACES RED as a pilot program to build up test capabilities for space hardware,” Nixon said. “We are hoping to gain future capabilities such as more refined attitude determination and control for satellites to help orient them when in space, as well as taking industrial-grade computers and testing them in a space environment. 

“Where you might see possibly tens of thousands of dollars for a piece of existing hardware, we are looking at hundreds of dollars,” he added.

One engineer added that this will mean SMDC can create something in-house with most of the parts that are going into space being designed and assembled here on Redstone Arsenal by in-house engineers.

“In the future the turnaround time, lead time and creating another iteration of ACES RED is going be quicker, faster and we are going to be able to get space hardware up there a lot faster and all the capabilities were designed here so we won’t have to outsource any of the design,” said Gauge Day, ACES RED chief engineer.

Day said initially his main role on ACES RED was working with the mechanical team and they had to figure out what direction the team was going to take with the design. He then took on the role of lead structural designer.

“My main focus and what I want to see come out of ACES RED is that we design a modular system for space,” Day said. “With it we are able to take modular trays out and can plug and play with different hardware, and any time we need to change something or something fails, we are able to swap it out and replace it. There is no stack feature so it is different from what most space systems have seen before with CubeSats.

“I want to see this become successful. Through vibrations and environmental testing so far we have been successful with something that is not native to space,” he added.

Day explained how the ACES RED modular system design is more convenient than a stackable system because replacing parts in stackable system is more difficult.

“With a stackable system, if your fourth board breaks, then you have to take the three on top of it off to get to the fourth one,” Day said. “ACES RED actually had this problem during an environmental test where a board needed replacing and we were able to slide a board out and replace it with a new one and it worked just fine.”

ACES RED is scheduled to be launched on a Falcon 9 rocket and attached to the outside of the International Space Station through the Department of Defense Space Test Program.

“Right now our payload is down at Johnson Space Center in Texas and it is being integrated into a full launch payload pallet with other experiments on it,” said Elizabeth Neilson, ACES RED lead systems engineer and integration specialist. “That pallet will then go through its own iteration of environmental testing and once it is finished we will be able to fix any issues that may come up during that time.

“We have definitely had a lot of lessons learned with ACES RED,” she added. “Our team was almost entirely composed of young engineers or college students and recent college graduates. There was a big learning curve and this was one of the first projects for a lot of people where people are actually designing space hardware that is going to be launched. There were a lot of things that tripped us up that we didn’t know going into it.”

Neilson said the support team at SMDC, leaders, and the research and technology team are always there to help them whenever they discover a problem.

She described how the CAL trains and mentors college students and young professionals via the Department of Defense's Science, Mathematics And Research for Transformation, or SMART, scholarship, which pays students full scholarship, stipend, insurance, and more to encourage science and technology studies.

Neilson also added that students at UAH can also work in the CAL via the Students working at the Army in parallel, or SWAP, where they are hired through a contract with UAH.

“Everybody on this team brought their own unique flair to it,” Neilson said. “The more experienced engineers know how things are supposed to work whereas it is nice to have younger engineers who get tripped up with issues and they have to think through the process.

“Then you have younger engineers who are asking questions and trying to learn along the way,” she added. “There are people coming in who have only designed theoretical projects for their classes and by the end of ACES RED they are making something that is going into space. So they are making all the mistakes that can be made and have learned lessons for future reference and they will wind up being really good engineers for the next project.”",2018/5/11,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/276716/smdc-builds-tests-satellite-components-with-aces-red,"REDSTONE ARSENAL, AL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国阿尔卑斯州红石兵工厂,SMDC使用ACES RED构建、测试卫星组件,阿拉巴马州红石兵工厂―在处理陆军卫星技术的未来时，SMDC保持其ACES红色。陆军成本效益太空飞行研究实验和演示，或ACES红色，是美国陆军航天和导弹防御司令部/陆军向小卫星提供战略司令部技术示范，以支持辐射技术和阿拉巴马大学亨茨维尔分校或UAH的陆军和指挥技术目标。系统管理和生产中心.ACES-RED是在USASMDC/ARSTRAT技术中心的概念分析实验室（简称CAL）开发的。CAL将高中生和大学生聚集在SMDC技术中心政府员工的监督和指导下，为政府项目和SMDC研究执行实际任务。“ACES RED旨在提高指挥部其他项目飞行任务不同组件的技术准备水平，”ACES RED主要调查员梅森・尼克松（Mason Nixon）说。“我们正在采用不同的技术，并试图在降低风险的同时推进这些技术，以便其他项目不必如此。我们还希望培训新员工，并在支持我们任务的核心领域建立技术能力。”该实验旨在快速成熟各种商用现货技术，以降低成本和复杂性，并保持未来陆军小型卫星的性能。其主要技术目标是通过以各种组合或配置实现多个传感器来解决矢量问题。ACES RED的次要目标包括成熟非传统和商用现货（COTS），即工业级组件，以取代传统的加固和更昂贵的空间系统，如飞行计算机、存储设备、成像传感器和姿态确定设备。尼克松说：“我们还将使用ACES RED作为试点项目，以建立太空硬件的测试能力。”。“我们希望获得未来的能力，例如更精确的卫星姿态确定和控制，以帮助卫星在太空中定向，以及携带工业级计算机并在太空环境中进行测试。“你可能会看到一件现有的硬件可能要花费数万美元，但我们要花几百美元，”他补充说。一位工程师补充说，这意味着SMDC可以在内部创造一些东西，将进入太空的大部分零件由内部工程师在红石兵工厂设计和组装。“在未来，ACES RED的周转时间、交付周期和创建另一个迭代将越来越快，我们将能够更快地获得空间硬件，所有功能都是在这里设计的，因此我们不必将任何设计外包。”ACES RED首席工程师Gauge Day说。Day说，最初他在ACES RED上的主要角色是与机械团队合作，他们必须确定团队在设计方面的方向。然后，他担任首席结构设计师。Day说：“我的主要关注点和我想看到的是，我们设计了一个模块化的空间系统。”。“有了它，我们可以取出模块化托盘，并可以使用不同的硬件进行即插即用，并且在任何时候我们需要更改某些内容或某些内容出现故障时，我们都可以将其交换并更换。由于没有堆叠功能，因此它与大多数空间系统以前使用立方体卫星看到的情况不同。他补充道：“我希望看到这项技术取得成功。通过振动和环境测试，到目前为止，我们已经成功地开发出了一些非太空固有的产品。”Day解释了ACES RED模块化系统设计如何比可堆叠系统更方便，因为更换可堆叠系统中的部件更困难。Day说：“在可堆叠系统中，如果第四块板子坏了，那么你必须把上面的三块板子取下来，才能找到第四块板子。ACES RED在一次环境测试中遇到了这个问题，当时有一块板子需要更换，我们可以将一块板子滑出来，换上一块新的，效果很好。”ACES RED计划由猎鹰9号火箭发射，并通过国防部空间测试计划连接到国际空间站外部。“目前，我们的有效载荷在德克萨斯州约翰逊航天中心降落，并与其他实验一起集成到一个完整的发射有效载荷托盘中。”ACES红铅系统工程师和集成专家Elizabeth Neilson说：“然后，该托盘将进行自己的环境测试迭代，一旦完成，我们将能够解决在此期间可能出现的任何问题。”她补充道，“我们肯定从ACES红铅系统中吸取了很多经验教训。”。“我们的团队几乎完全由年轻的工程师或大学生以及新近的大学毕业生组成。这是一个巨大的学习曲线，这是许多人的第一个项目之一，他们实际上正在设计即将发射的空间硬件。有很多事情让我们绊倒，我们不知道“去吧。”Neilson说，SMDC的支持团队、领导者以及研究和技术团队在他们发现问题时总是在那里帮助他们。她描述了加州大学如何通过国防部的科学、数学和转型研究或SMART奖学金培训和指导大学生和年轻专业人员，该奖学金向学生支付全额奖学金、津贴、保险等，以鼓励科学和技术学习。Neilson还补充说，UAH的学生也可以通过与UAH签订合同在陆军并行工作或交换的学生在加州大学工作。“这个团队中的每个人都有自己独特的才能。”Neilson说：“经验更丰富的工程师知道事情应该如何运作，而年轻的工程师被问题绊倒，他们必须思考整个过程，这是很好的。”她补充道：“然后，年轻的工程师会提出问题，并试图一路学习。”。“进来的人只为他们的课程设计了理论项目，到ACES RED结束时，他们正在做一些即将进入太空的事情。因此，他们犯下了所有可以犯的错误，并吸取了经验教训供将来参考，他们最终将成为下一个项目的真正优秀工程师。”
143,337th ACS- training international brothers and sisters in arms,"To aid and augment the aerial capabilities of U.S. allies, one Tyndall squadron teaches a portion of Air Force techniques to international military officers.

“The mission of the 337th Air Control Squadron International Studies is to teach international military officers U.S. techniques for command and control of combat air operations,” said Lt. Col. Alexander Maclean, 337th ACS director of international studies. “Our building block approach to instruction offers a student the tools necessary to become proficient with core skills on both the tactical and operational level of war.”

The 337th ACS offers two classes, the International Air Weapons Controller Course and the Theater Air Operations Course four times per year, lasting approximately two and a half months and three weeks respectively, as part of the curriculum offered under the Air Force Security Assistance Training Program. 

“Of the 56 nations offered the class, currently there are an approximate 18 countries sending between 50 to 60 students annually,” Maclean said. 

Maclean explained that through this partnership, international students were not the only beneficiaries of the training opportunity. 

“We offer students and U.S. cadre a unique opportunity to foster lasting relationships with friendly nations through open dialog regarding professional differences, doctrine and culture,” he said. “This course pays dividends down-range when our cadre and personnel interact with course graduates in an operational environment.”

In an environment of Total Force Integration and joint environments the training that occurs at the 337th ACS can be viewed as the future of air dominance, albeit not a new advent.

“The 337th ACS has been training international students from over 56 countries for more than 50 years,” Maclean said. “Training has evolved to incorporate the latest techniques for counter-air and counter-land operations employed by Airborne Warning and Control Systems, Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System, Control and Reporting Centers, and Air Operations Centers.” 

Maclean closed with his thoughts of the importance of the capabilities his squadron provides to the war fighting effort. 

“In today’s multi-national environment, the International Studies Directorate offers an opportunity for Tyndall personnel to interact with our international partners. It offers team Tyndall personnel to help foster the building of partnership capacity,” he concluded.",2017/10/4,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/250540/337th-acs-training-international-brothers-and-sisters-arms,"TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE, FL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佛罗里达州廷德尔空军基地,337 ACS-训练国际武装兄弟姐妹,为了帮助和增强美国盟国的空中能力，一个廷德尔空军中队向国际军官传授一部分空军技术。“337空中控制中队国际研究的任务是向国际军官传授美国对作战空中行动的指挥和控制技术。”第337届ACS国际研究主任亚历山大・麦克莱恩中校说。“我们的积木式教学法为学生提供了精通战争战术和作战层面核心技能所需的工具。”337 ACS提供了两门课程，即国际空中武器控制员课程和战区空中作战课程，每年四次，分别持续约两个半月和三周，作为空军安全援助培训计划课程的一部分。麦克莱恩说：“在提供这门课程的56个国家中，目前大约有18个国家每年派出50至60名学生。”。麦克莱恩解释说，通过这种合作关系，国际学生并不是培训机会的唯一受益者。他说：“我们为学生和美国干部提供了一个独特的机会，通过就职业差异、教义和文化进行公开对话，与友好国家建立持久的关系。”。“当我们的干部和人员在作战环境中与课程毕业生互动时，这门课程会在一定范围内产生回报。”在部队全面整合和联合环境中，337 ACS的训练可以被视为未来的空中优势，尽管这不是一个新的发展。麦克莱恩说：“50多年来，337 ACS一直在培训来自56个国家的国际学生。”。“训练已经演变为将机载警报和控制系统、联合监视和目标攻击雷达系统、控制和报告中心以及空中作战中心所采用的最新空对地作战技术结合起来。”麦克莱恩最后谈到了他的中队提供的作战能力的重要性。他总结道：“在当今的多国环境中，国际研究理事会为廷德尔团队人员提供了与国际合作伙伴互动的机会。它为廷德尔团队人员提供了帮助，以促进伙伴关系能力的建设。”。
144,FRCE aces quality management surveillance audit with zero findings,"MARINE CORPS AIR STATION CHERRY POINT, N.C. C Every industry has certifications that indicate standards of excellence achieved through the use of best practices. At a restaurant, diners may look to health inspection scores as a signal of safety; when it comes to vehicle repairs, consumers might seek a mechanic that is Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certified. 

In the aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul industry, Aerospace Standard (AS) 9110 serves as the benchmark for excellence. Following a recent third-party surveillance audit, Fleet Readiness Center East (FRCE) became the first aviation depot within Commander, Fleet Readiness Centers (COMFRC) to pass an AS9110 audit with no findings. 

The result represents years of hard work and collaboration between many of FRCE’s internal departments, including Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO) Production, MRO Logistics, MRO Engineering, Facilities and Infrastructure Management, and Compliance and Quality. 

“As the first Fleet Readiness Center to complete an AS9110 audit with zero findings, it’s clear that our team’s hard work is paying off,” said Tina Rowe, MRO Production director at FRCE. “We are becoming the benchmark for the enterprise in how we do business; now, we need to keep the momentum going and sustain our standings so our customers continue to send work and to entice new customers and their potential workload.”

AS9110 assesses the processes, procedures and efficiencies of an organization’s quality management system. Conformance to the AS9110 standard is voluntary, and represents an above-and-beyond commitment to quality, said David Spencer, director of the Standards Division within FRCE’s Compliance and Quality Department.

“Customers can bring their business here knowing that our services are going to meet or exceed the intent of industry certification standards,” he explained. “Because we maintain this industry standard, our customers don’t need to come into our depot and do their own review of our processes. They can rest assured knowing that we're certified, that our systems are going to be right and tight, and that we’re going to get the job done with their products.”

Having the AS9110 certification makes FRCE an attractive choice for potential industry customers and helps the command retain existing customers, added FRCE Quality Manager Jeffrey O’Connell.  

“In the public-private partnership environment that we’re in, a lot of private industry weighs the AS9110 certification heavily in considering where they go for work,” O’Connell said. “For some of the companies that work with us, having this certification makes it easier for them to partner with us than it would have been without it.”

The AS9110 standard, developed by the International Aerospace Quality Group, is not prescriptive C it doesn’t provide an organization with specific instructions to do the things required for certification, Spencer noted. Rather, it provides an outline of the requirements and certification to this standard assesses conformance to those requirements through a series of audits. A full recertification audit takes place every three years; in between, annual surveillance audits like the one conducted this summer take place at certified facilities to ensure continued conformance to the standard. 

Whether assessing parts control and traceability, artisan training, product safety or a top management review, the standard doesn’t tell an organization how to do something, Spencer explained. “Instead, it breaks down the things you need to have, and the different layers of the organization that do those things. It’s really an external set of eyes that can come in and give us a good scrub.”

In addition to being the first FRC to complete AS9110 certification or surveillance with no audit findings, FRCE also became the first depot to earn certification from fence-to-fence, geographically speaking, rather than working to earn certification in individual buildings or lines. The cross-disciplinary, top-down approach toward quality management required to achieve whole-depot certification also helped FRCE shine in its most recent audit.

Daily meetings with MRO Production leadership provide a venue in which the team can rapidly address and resolve any quality management issues identified, Spencer said. The Facilities and Infrastructure Department head often sits in these meetings, as well, providing another level of support. Weekly meetings that also bring in MRO Logistics, MRO Engineering and the Compliance and Quality Department, offer opportunities to solve higher-level issues. 

“This is not a triage meeting,” O’Connell explained. “We’re not trying to find and address a specific issue C we’re trying to determine why an issue occurred and whether we can get a process in place to address it. We’re dedicating some time to problem-solve, rather than simply triaging and firefighting, because firefighting never ends.”

The commitment from top management to addressing quality management issues at the root level has made a huge difference in the team’s ability to address concerns, which in turn leads to better performance in audit situations and improved throughput and cost efficiency. 

“It’s management that’s gotten us to the point we’re at,” O’Connell said. “We could be here 20 hours a day and, without that management support, we would still be nowhere near the level we’re performing at now.”

Confidence in the depot’s quality management systems led the team to implement a new approach when the auditors arrived; instead of having a set tour schedule, Spencer and O’Connell let the auditors guide the process. 
“It was completely open: This is our business, and this is how we’re doing it. If you see things to improve, we want to know because we want to improve it,” O’Connell said. 

Spencer said the level of performance required to be comfortable with this free-range approach took years to achieve. 

“If the auditors wanted to go see a process at the materials lab, we’d call the materials lab. They asked when the auditors wanted to come over, and I’d tell him they’d be there in five minutes,” Spencer said. “And then it was, what would you like to see next? And the auditors had entourages of leadership, from the senior to junior levels, guiding them around throughout the entire process. That’s indicative of a remarkable commitment to the program and level of support, and it has taken years to get here.”

In addition to leadership commitment, an organizational restructuring to a mission-aligned organization, which took place at FRCE and across the Naval Air Systems Command enterprise in 2019, has helped improve results. 

“Each department’s goals are more aligned to a single end goal then they have ever been,” O’Connell said. “In the past, if an audit turned up a finding, the team would work to define whose problem that was. Now it’s everybody’s problem because if it’s a quality issue, that’s going to hamper all of us in getting to the end goal. People are engaged, and we fix it.”

The changes in the way quality issues get addressed represent a culture change within FRCE, Spencer added. 

“We now attack issues and get them resourced, make them manageable and get them under control before they become problems,” he said. “We’re seeing excitement in a lot of people, not just the leadership but throughout the workforce and the people who are the customers of these processes. The rapid execution is helping with morale, it’s helping change the culture, and it’s impressive. 

“This certification is a big deal, and the leadership commitment and support to the program has put us light years ahead of where we’ve ever been,” Spencer said.

FRCE is North Carolina's largest maintenance, repair, overhaul and technical services provider, with more than 4,000 civilian, military and contract workers. Its annual revenue exceeds $1 billion.

145,AMC commander speaks at 30-4-30 Series,"SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE, Ill.--The commander of Air Mobility Command spoke to members of U.S. Transportation Command July 10 in the Seay Auditorium, as part of USTRANSCOM’s 30-4-30 Distinguished Speakers Series.
 
Gen. Carlton D. Everhart II spoke on squadron revitalization, modernization and readiness during the event, which is designed to celebrate USTRANSCOM’s 30th anniversary in October 2017 and provide enhanced insight into the linkages between the command and the senior leader’s organization and mission.
 
Everhart highlighted AMC’s role as the air component of USTRANSCOM, and the command’s partnerships with other component commands and allied partners.
 
During his speech, Everhart described AMC as “the most joint major command in the entire Air Force.”
 
“I say this because whether it’s airlift, aeromedical evacuation, mobility or air refueling, we are always looking at supporting someone in a different uniform,” he said.
 
Everhart used the Misawa Air Base’s aeromedical evacuation mission and the 821st Contingency Response Group’s air base opening in Syria as examples of joint partnerships working together to get the mission done.
 
“When the joint force needs medical care, our AE teams answer,” Everhart said. “When the warfighter needs to move to a region where there is no established presence, they call on our contingency response Airmen.”
 
Everhart continued by discussing the four aspects of AMC’s “Rapid Global Mobility Now and Tomorrow” concept ― readiness, growing and developing Airmen, modernization and nuclear operations.
 
“Our Airmen are the foundation of everything we do,” he said. “In today’s high end fight, everyone should be thinking about Rapid Global Mobility Now and logistics.”
 
The general stated the word “tomorrow” was added because he wanted his Airmen to not only remember what they do each day, but also consider AMC’s future.
 
“I want to emphasize the importance of looking at today’s victories, but also how we are setting ourselves up for the future in all four of these focus areas,” he said. “What we’re setting the table with right now is what we’re going to live with in 2030, so I need my folks to think about that and how it affects joint operations.”
 
The general touched on readiness, saying AMC recognizes the world has changed over the past decade, and the command has worked with commercial partners and industry in developing new and innovative ideas that enhance AMC’s ability to meet mission demands.
 
Over the past decade, AMC has improved processes, including increasing cargo efficiency from 60 percent to 90 percent, and improving tanker scheduling processes to make better use of AMC’s existing fleet.
 
“We’re looking at how we prioritize missions,” the general said. “Advocating for global command and control of mobility assets ensures that, when the capacity is not there to meet all mission demands, we are getting after the most important missions.”
 
Everhart stated AMC will execute its first Mobility Guardian exercise this August. The exercise will help enhance skills and identify where AMC needs to make further improvements.
 
“Mobility Guardian is going to be AMC’s premier exercise,” Everhart said. “It will test our ability to prepare the force, sustain the force, and after the mission is over, come in and clean it all up. If you need to go by air to accomplish this, then it’s AMC you call. That’s what Mobility Guardian is designed to do ― exercise our wartime mission.”
 
The importance of squadron revitalization and the command’s ability to grow and develop its Airmen was another area the general focused on, saying “the squadron is the heartbeat of the organization and growing our Airmen starts in the squadron.”
 
“Development is about giving our Airmen the tools and training to achieve their potential, whether that’s being the best maintainer on the flight line, the best aviator in your squadron or a future commander,” he said.
 
When speaking on modernization, Everhart said the KC-46 is the first step in modernizing the tanker fleet but it’s only one aspect of modernization in AMC.
 
“AMC is pursuing several initiatives to stay ahead of our adversaries and ensure rapid global mobility for the nation, including how we can strengthen our role in multi-domain command and control, as well as examining what air refueling looks like in contested airspace in 2030 and beyond.”
 
The general ended his speech by thanking members of USTRANSCOM and its component commands for helping AMC accomplish its mission.
 
“Rapid Global Mobility is not just an AMC or USTRANSCOM concept, it is a national concept. Rapid Global Mobility is a national treasure,” he said. “I hope you understand that AMC can’t do its mission without you.”",2017/7/11,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/241458/amc-commander-speaks-30-4-30-series,"SCOTT AIR FORCE BASE, IL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国伊利诺伊州斯科特空军基地,陆军装备司令部司令在30-4-30系列节目上讲话,伊利诺伊州斯科特空军基地――7月10日，空军机动司令部司令在Seay礼堂向美国运输司令部成员发表讲话，这是USTRANSCOM 30-4-30杰出演讲者系列的一部分。Carlton D.Everhart II在活动期间就中队振兴、现代化和准备就绪发表了讲话，其目的是在2017年10月庆祝USTRANSCOM成立30周年，并进一步深入了解司令部与高级领导人的组织和任务之间的联系。埃弗哈特强调了AMC作为USTRANSCOM空中部门的作用，埃弗哈特在讲话中称AMC是“整个空军中最联合的主要司令部”“我之所以这么说，是因为无论是空运、航空医疗后送、机动还是空中加油，我们都在考虑为穿着不同制服的人提供支持。”埃弗哈特以米萨瓦空军基地的航空医疗后送任务和821应急响应小组在叙利亚的空军基地开放为例，说明了为完成任务而共同合作的伙伴关系。埃弗哈特说：“当联合部队需要医疗护理时，我们的AE团队负责。”。“当作战人员需要移动到一个没有现成存在的地区时，他们会呼叫我们的应急响应飞行员。”埃弗哈特继续讨论了AMC“现在和未来快速全球机动”概念的四个方面――准备就绪、空军的成长和发展、现代化和核作战。“我们的飞行员是我们所做的一切的基础，”他说，“在今天的高端战斗中，每个人都应该考虑现在全球快速的流动性和后勤。”将军说“明天”这个词是因为他希望飞行员不仅记住他们每天做的事情，而且还考虑AMC的未来。“我想强调看到今天的胜利的重要性，以及我们如何在所有四个重点领域为未来做准备，”他说。“我们现在要做的是在2030年我们将要面对什么，所以我需要我的家人思考这一点，以及它如何影响联合作战。”这位将军谈到了战备情况，他说，陆军装备司令部认识到过去十年来世界发生了变化，司令部与商业伙伴和工业界合作开发了新的创新理念，以增强陆军装备司令部满足任务需求的能力。在过去十年中，陆军装备司令部改进了流程，包括提高了从60%至90%，并改进油轮调度流程，以更好地利用AMC现有船队。“我们正在研究如何确定任务优先级，”将军说。“倡导对机动资产进行全球指挥和控制，可确保在能力无法满足所有任务需求时，我们能够完成最重要的任务。”埃弗哈特表示，AMC将于今年8月进行其第一次机动卫士演习。该演习将有助于提高技能，并确定AMC需要进一步改进的地方。“机动卫士将是AMC的首要演习，”埃弗哈特说。“这将考验我们准备部队、维持部队的能力，在任务结束后，进来把一切清理干净。如果你需要乘飞机来完成这项任务，那你就呼叫陆军装备司令部。这就是机动卫士的设计目的――执行我们的战时任务。”中队振兴的重要性以及司令部增加和发展其飞行员的能力是将军关注的另一个领域，他说“中队是组织的心脏，增加我们的飞行员从中队开始。”“发展是为我们的飞行员提供工具和培训，以实现他们的潜力，无论他们是飞行线上最好的维修人员、中队最好的飞行员还是未来的指挥官。”埃弗哈特在谈到现代化时说，KC-46是油轮船队现代化的第一步，但这只是AMC现代化的一个方面。“陆军装备司令部正在实施多项举措，以保持领先于我们的对手，确保国家在全球范围内快速机动，包括如何加强我们在多领域指挥和控制中的作用，以及研究2030年及以后有争议空域的空中加油情况。”这位将军在演讲结束时感谢美国陆军司令部及其下属司令部的成员帮助美国陆军装备司令部完成任务。“快速全球机动不仅是美国陆军装备司令部或美国陆军司令部的概念，也是一个国家概念。快速全球机动是一件国宝，”他说。“我希望你明白，没有你，美国陆军装备司令部无法完成使命。”
146,30 seconds of green,"Team McChord Airmen along with Airmen from other Air Mobility Command units recently participated in the Battalion Mass Tactical Week exercise at Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina, Feb. 27 through March 2.  

More than 100 Airmen from Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington; Dyess Air Force Base, Texas; Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina; Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii; and Little Rock AFB, Arkansas, participated in the exercise to airdrop more than 2,400 Soldiers.    

The exercise took place to provide hands-on training to AMC aircrews while supporting Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division stationed at Fort Bragg, N.C. 

“Overall throughout the week we were able to accomplish quite a bit of training that goes a long way in things we are not necessarily able to accomplish at home-station,” said Lt. Col. Jaron Roux, 62nd Operations Support Squadron commander and the exercise air mission commander. “The interoperability that we gain when we bring the C-17 Globemaster III and C-130J crews together here is fantastic.”

During the exercise, aircrews received training in a variety of areas to include formation flying, airdrop, static-line jumps of Army personnel and the experience of working with Airmen from different squadrons. 

“This week the primary training is for us to support the 82nd Airborne Division as well as supporting C-17 and C-130J upgrade training,” said Roux. “The 82nd is an airborne unit that’s postured to respond to different contingencies all over the globe and parachute operations is essential to their readiness.”

For some McChord Airmen this was their first opportunity to airdrop Soldiers from the C-17. 

""This was a great experience; I learned a lot,” said Staff Sgt. Justin Baez, 7th Airlift Squadron loadmaster. “Seeing that this is a new qualification for me, I appreciate the opportunity to work with everyone here and receive this training in a realistic training environment.” 

Aircrews flew day and night shifts each day of the exercise and flew in formations ranging from three-to-six aircraft. The exercise schedule stuck to a fixed timeframe that required aircrews to drop personnel and cargo at specified drop zones that allowed only 30-50 seconds of a “green light” to make the drop. 

Aircrews from McChord Field were provided a unique training opportunity during the exercise because it’s not often that they’re able to train in environments like these, said Roux.      

“It really makes you appreciate all the mission planning that takes place prior to these exercises,” said Baez. ""I had to be adaptable and ready to make any last minute changes. There are countless hours that lead up to 30 seconds over the drop zone.” 

Though only a week-long, the exercise planning started at the beginning of the year by the 62nd OSS, said Roux. Planning took into consideration the training needs of all aircrew and support personnel participating in the exercise.     

“We bring the whole team out here to include maintenance personnel, weather professionals and squadron aviation resource management Airmen,” said Roux. “It’s a joint-training effort that happens throughout the week.”

Although Airmen faced some challenging weather during the week, the exercise was a success, said Roux. 

“I think each time we come out here and do these exercises we learn things as an enterprise,” said Roux. “We learn if there are shortfalls we need to work on, but we also see things that we do very well and this week was no different.”",2017/3/7,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/226179/30-seconds-green,"POPE ARMY AIRFIELD, WA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国华盛顿州波普陆军机场,30秒绿灯,2月27日至3月2日，麦克霍德空军和其他空中机动司令部的空军最近参加了在北卡罗来纳州波普陆军机场举行的营大规模战术周演习。来自华盛顿刘易斯・麦考德联合基地的100多名飞行员；德克萨斯州戴斯空军基地；南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿联合基地；夏威夷希卡姆珍珠港联合基地；阿肯色州小石城空军基地参加了空投2400多名士兵的演习。演习的目的是为陆军装备司令部空勤人员提供实践训练，同时为驻扎在北卡罗来纳州布拉格堡的第82空降师的士兵提供支持。“总的来说，这一周我们完成了相当多的训练，这些训练对我们在本站不一定能够完成的事情大有帮助。”第62作战支援中队指挥官兼演习空中任务指挥官Jaron Roux中校说。“当我们将C-17 Globemaster III和C-130J机组人员聚集在一起时，我们获得的互操作性非常好。”在演习期间，机组人员接受了多方面的培训，包括编队飞行、空投、陆军人员的静态跳线以及与不同中队的飞行员合作的经验。“本周的主要训练是支持第82空降师以及支持C-17和C-130J升级训练，”鲁克斯说。“第82空降队是一支空降部队，它的姿态是应对全球不同的突发事件，降落伞行动对他们的准备工作至关重要。”对于一些麦科德空军来说，这是他们第一次有机会空投C-17的士兵。“这是一次很好的经历；我学到了很多，”第七空运中队装载员上士贾斯汀・贝兹说。“看到这对我来说是一项新的资格认证，我很高兴有机会与这里的每个人一起工作，并在现实的培训环境中接受培训。”空勤人员每天日夜轮班飞行，编队从3架飞机到6架飞机不等。演习日程固定，要求空勤人员将人员和货物降落在指定的降落区，只允许30-50秒的“绿灯”在这次演习中，来自麦考德机场的空勤人员获得了一次独特的训练机会，因为他们很少能够在这样的环境中训练，鲁克斯说。“这让你真正体会到在这些演习之前进行的所有任务规划，”贝兹说我必须适应环境，随时准备在最后一刻做出任何改变。在降落区有数不清的时间长达30秒。“虽然只有一周的时间，但演习计划在今年年初由第62届OSS开始，Roux说。计划考虑了所有参与演习的机组人员和支援人员的培训需求。“我们把整个团队带到这里来，包括维修人员、气象专业人员和中队航空资源管理飞行员，”鲁克斯说。“这是一项为期一周的联合训练。”鲁克斯说，尽管飞行员在这一周面临着一些具有挑战性的天气，但这次演习还是成功的。“我认为，每次我们来到这里，做这些练习，我们都会作为一个企业来学习，”鲁克斯说。“我们知道是否有不足需要解决，但我们也看到我们做得很好的事情，本周也不例外。”

MUSEUM DISPLAY, MEMORIAL STONE COMMEMORATE DESERT SHIELD, DESERT STORM


FORT LEONARD WOOD, Mo. ― August 2, 1990, was the date many Americans first learned about the country of Kuwait, and that Iraq ― which had been a U.S. ally ― invaded it. Soon, millions would be glued to cable news, watching Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm unfold, from U.S.-led coalition building and training to deployment, combat operations and victory ― all in just over six months.

It’s been 30 years since the Gulf War captivated the nation’s attention. While the U.S. has conducted multiple operations since that time, many reminders of the Gulf War remain, including two permanent fixtures at Fort Leonard Wood.

The Desert Storm Memorial Stone has been a part of Memorial Grove since it was installed and dedicated in 2016. Veterans, family members and others still place coins, pins, dog tags and other mementos on the stone in remembrance of those who served and sacrificed.

Another reminder is the 1991 Desert Storm Display, located in the U.S. Army Engineer Museum inside the John B. Mahaffey Museum Complex.

“It’s basically commemorating all engineers (serving) in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm,” explained Troy Morgan, Engineer Museum director.

A part of the museum since the early 1990s, the display features multiple photos and artifacts from the Gulf War, from a U.S. Army uniform from the era to U.S. and Iraqi weapons and equipment.

“That piece of shrapnel in there ― that’s from a S.C.U.D. missile,” Morgan said as he gave an overview of the display. “You’ll see an Iraqi helmet, an Iraqi canteen. These yellow and black signs are the Iraqi minefield markers. And this license plate is from an Iraqi Army vehicle.”

According to the “1991 Engineer Center Annual Command History,” the Gulf War impacted nearly every activity on Fort Leonard Wood in some way in 1990 and 1991, with nearly 4,000 Soldiers passing through the installation for processing, training and deployment.

Three Fort Leonard Wood units, the 5th Engineer Battalion, the 93rd Evacuation Hospital and the 515th Engineer Company (Pipeline), were deployed to the Persian Gulf.

Of the three, the 5th Engineers were involved in major combat operations in support of the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry Division.

According to the unit’s history listed on its official Facebook page, the “Fightin’ Fifth” was notified Aug. 12, 1990, of its deployment, which began in late October with their arrival in Saudi Arabia. There, they constructed Sapper Base, an 800-Soldier base camp and were responsible for conducting long-range reconnaissance along the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 5th Engr. Bn. Soldiers were on the front lines with the 24th ID once U.S. forces began their attack. The unit breached 8-meter high, double earthen berms, fought as infantry against Iraqi forces and destroyed Iraqi war materials, including hundreds of bunkers, weapons, rail lines and more.

Like many Soldiers throughout history, several 5th Engr. Bn. Soldiers picked up souvenirs during their tour, many of which were donated to the museum. In fact, Morgan said, most of the items now in the museum display were donated by the 5th Engineer Battalion, including a distinctive highway sign that hangs above the hallway where it is located.

“You can see it says ‘Baghdad,’ ‘Highway 1’ and it also has a small brass plaque in the corner that’s sometimes hard to see,” Morgan said.

Although the 5th Engineer Battalion’s scope of training and operations have changed somewhat over the past 30 years, the Gulf War remains an important chapter in the history of the unit, according to Maj. Tyson Behnke, 5th Engr. Bn. executive officer.

“As a battalion in (U.S. Army Forces Command), the (5th Engineer Battalion) and its subordinate units are still expected to maintain readiness and deploy in support of contingency and non-contingency operations throughout the world,” Behnke said. “The battalion no longer has organic construction assets but maintains the ability to command and control and sustain those assets if assigned.”

While the museum complex has been closed to the public since March due to COVID-19 mitigation procedures, the 1991 Desert Storm display isn’t going anywhere. In fact, Morgan noted, the display is scheduled for an upgrade in the near future.

“We try to upgrade all the time. This is scheduled for an upgrade in 2022,” he said. “We’ll basically change the artifacts, rip down the carpet and widen this (window) to make it easier for visitors to see it as they approach the display.”

Visitors can also be assured that the display commemorating the Gulf War will be around for many years to come, Morgan said.

“We have what we call temporary displays and long-term displays ― this is a long-term display,” he said.",2020/8/2,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/376670/gulf-war-turns-30,"FORT LEONARD WOOD , MO, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国密苏里州伦纳德伍德堡,海湾战争即将结束,1990年8月2日是许多美国人第一次了解科威特这个国家的日子，当时伊拉克是美国的盟友，入侵了这个国家。很快，数百万人就会被有线电视新闻所吸引，观看沙漠盾牌行动和沙漠风暴的展开，从美国领导的联盟建设和训练到部署、作战行动和胜利――所有这些都发生在短短六个多月的时间里。海湾战争吸引了美国的注意力，至今已有30年了。尽管美国从那时起已经进行了多次行动，但海湾战争的许多提醒仍然存在，包括莱昂纳德伍德堡的两个永久性设施。沙漠风暴纪念石自2016年安装并投入使用以来一直是纪念林的一部分。退伍军人、家庭成员和其他人仍然在石头上放置硬币、别针、狗标签和其他纪念品，以纪念那些曾经服役和牺牲过的人。另一个提醒是1991年的沙漠风暴展览，位于约翰・B・马哈菲博物馆综合体内的美国陆军工程师博物馆。“它基本上是为了纪念所有（服役的）工程师。”“在沙漠盾牌行动和沙漠风暴中，”工程师博物馆馆长特洛伊・摩根解释说。该展览自20世纪90年代初以来一直是博物馆的一部分，展出了海湾战争时期的多张照片和文物，从当时的美军制服到美国和伊拉克的武器装备。“那片弹片在那里――那是一枚s.C.U.D.导弹的碎片，”摩根一边概述展示一边说。“你会看到一个伊拉克头盔，一个伊拉克食堂。这些黄色和黑色的标志是伊拉克雷区的标志。而这个车牌来自一辆伊拉克军车。”海湾战争变成301/2显示字幕+海湾战争变成302/2显示字幕+根据“1991年工程师中心年度指挥历史，”1990年和1991年，海湾战争以某种方式影响了莱昂纳德伍德堡的几乎所有活动，近4000名士兵通过该设施进行加工、训练和部署。莱昂纳德伍德堡有三个部队、第五工兵营、第93疏散医院和第515工兵连（管道）部署到波斯湾。在这三名工程师中，第五名工程师参与了支持第24步兵师第一营的主要作战行动。根据该部队在其官方Facebook页面上列出的历史，“第五次战斗”1990年8月12日，他们被通知部署该部队，该部队于10月下旬抵达沙特阿拉伯。在那里，他们建造了一个800人的工兵基地，并负责沿沙特阿拉伯和伊拉克之间的边界进行远程侦察。第5名英国士兵与第24名伊拉克士兵在前线nce美国军队开始进攻。这支部队突破了8米高的双土护堤，以步兵身份与伊拉克军队作战，摧毁了伊拉克战争物资，包括数百个掩体、武器、铁路线等。与历史上的许多士兵一样，几名英国第五军士兵在旅途中捡到了纪念品，其中许多是wMorgan说，事实上，博物馆陈列的大部分物品都是由第五工程营捐赠的，包括悬挂在其所在走廊上方的一个独特的公路标志。“你可以看到上面写着‘巴格达’，‘1号公路’，在角落里还有一块小铜牌，有时很难看到。”摩根说。尽管第五工程营的训练和作战范围在过去30年中有所改变，但根据第五工程营执行官泰森・贝恩克少校的说法，海湾战争仍然是该部队历史上的重要篇章。“作为（美国陆军司令部）的一个营，（第五工程营）贝恩克说：“该营不再拥有建制建筑资产，而是保持指挥、控制和维持这些资产的能力。”尽管由于新冠病毒-19的缓解程序，博物馆自3月以来一直不对公众开放，但1991年的沙漠风暴展览不会有任何进展。摩根指出，事实上，展览计划在不久的将来升级。“我们一直在努力升级。计划在2022年升级，”他说。摩根说：“我们将基本上改变文物，撕开地毯并拓宽这扇窗户，以便游客在接近展览时更容易看到它。”游客们还可以放心，纪念海湾战争的展览将在未来许多年内举行。“我们有所谓的临时显示器和长期显示器――这是一种长期显示器，”他说。
148,"30 years of service, marriage","In 1990, Desert storm was in full swing, “Hold On” was the No. 1 song, “Ghost” was the No. 1 movie, and Michael Jordan had yet to win an NBA championship. 

 

Tech. Sgt. Alison Bruce-Maldonado and Master Sgt. Emelio Maldonado, both active-duty Marines at the time, remember 1990 as the year they were married.

 

Their 30 years of marriage and military service taught them several life lessons they hope to pass on to their daughter and fellow Airmen. 

 

“The military taught us how to deal with difficult situations,” said Emelio, 93rd Civil Support Team healthcare non-commissioned officer in charge. “We’ve been able to pass that onto our kids because it’s not always going to be easy.”

 

That situation is especially true now, as Emelio and Alison respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

 

Emelio’s unit conducts refresher training on respirators and personal protective equipment for Hawaii National Guardsmen who are supporting the state with personnel and equipment.  

 

Meanwhile, Alison provides historical documentation of the 154th Wing’s response to the pandemic and captures images asserting the Air Force’s mission readiness. 

 

Times right now may be challenging, but the Maldonados have overcome obstacles before. In December 2011, Emilio suffered a massive heart attack. 

 

“It caught us both by surprise,” said Alison. “I remember after I arrived at the hospital, he was just waking up from his surgery. The doctor was in his room and had asked him how he was able to drive himself to the hospital with the chest pains he was having” 

 

“I told the doctor that I thought of Alison and knew if I didn’t make it, she would be heartbroken,” Emelio said. 

 

The doctors told the Maldonados that Emelio was a walking miracle because most people don’t survive the type heart attack he experienced. After the accident the Maldonados changed their eating habits to be healthier.    

 

Despite approaching 30 years of marriage, Emelio and Alison recognize the need to continuously work on their marriage. Their military service afforded the couple opportunities to enrich their marriage, such as the Stronger Bond program they recently attended to increase their communication skills and the resiliency of their marriage. 

 

“The Stronger Bond program improves Airmen as people,” said Emelio. “Having a stronger person makes for a stronger Airman. It reminded us that we still need to go on date nights.”

 

Although both originally from California, they both consider Hawaii home now. 

 

“Hawaii is where we met and we love it,” said Alison. “We are both here with no family so it makes us feel closer in our relationship.” 

 

Alison and Emelio both separated from the Marine Corps in 1991 and 1992, respectively, and they both joined the Air National Guard shortly after. Transitioning from the Marines to the Air Force had challenges, but the Marine slogan, “improvise, adapt, and overcome,” helped them succeed. 

 

As Alison prepares to retire, she hopes  the next generation of Airmen are as eager to learn as she has been. She’s served in four different career fields in the Air Force. 

 

“Every Airman out there has something to share, someone to teach and something to learn ― on purpose,” she said.  

 

The military presents certain challenges and having an open mind to learn can be paramount. 

 

“Don’t believe you'll ever be too experienced to learn something new,” she continued. “Like the saying goes don't judge a book by its cover, don’t judge an Airman by their rank. We all have a story for every stripe on our sleeves.”",2020/5/8,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/369629/30-years-service-marriage,"JBPHH, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],JBPHH，你好，美国,30年的服务、婚姻,1990年，沙漠风暴正如火如荼地进行，“坚持”是第一首歌，“幽灵”是第一部电影，迈克尔・乔丹还没有赢得NBA总冠军。技术中士艾莉森・布鲁斯・马尔多纳多（Alison Bruce Maldonado）和少校埃梅里奥・马尔多纳多（Emelio Maldonado）都是当时的现役海军陆战队成员，他们都记得1990年是他们结婚的一年。他们30年的婚姻和兵役生活教会了他们一些人生经验，他们希望将这些经验传授给女儿和其他飞行员。“军队教会了我们如何应对困难局面，”第93届民事支援小组医疗非委任负责人埃梅里奥说。“我们能够把这种情况传给我们的孩子，因为这并不总是容易的。”现在这种情况尤其如此，因为埃梅里奥和艾莉森对新冠疫情做出了反应。埃梅里奥的部队为夏威夷国民警卫队人员提供呼吸器和个人防护装备的进修培训，这些人员和装备为该州提供支持。与此同时，艾莉森提供了154联队应对流感大流行的历史记录，并拍摄了证明空军已做好任务准备的图像。现在的时代可能充满挑战，但马尔多纳多人以前已经克服了障碍。2011年12月，埃米利奥心脏病发作。艾莉森说：“这让我们俩都很惊讶。”。“我记得在我到达医院后，他刚从手术中醒来。医生在他的房间里，问他胸痛怎么能自己开车去医院。”“我告诉医生，我想到了艾莉森，知道如果我不去，她会心碎的，”埃梅里奥说。医生们告诉马尔多纳多夫妇，埃梅里奥是一个行走的奇迹，因为大多数人都无法从他经历的那种类型的心脏病发作中幸存下来。事故发生后，马尔多纳多人改变了饮食习惯，变得更健康。尽管结婚近30年，埃梅里奥和艾莉森认识到需要继续努力维持他们的婚姻。他们的军旅生涯为这对夫妇提供了丰富婚姻的机会，比如他们最近参加的“更牢固的纽带”计划，以提高他们的沟通技巧和婚姻的弹性。埃梅里奥说：“加强债券计划提高了飞行员的国民素质。”。“有一个更强壮的人会成为一个更强壮的飞行员。这提醒我们，我们仍然需要约会的夜晚。”虽然两人都是从加利福尼亚来的，但现在他们都把夏威夷当成了家。艾莉森说：“夏威夷是我们相遇的地方，我们很喜欢它。”。艾莉森和埃梅里奥分别于1991年和1992年离开海军陆战队，不久后加入了空军国民警卫队。从海军陆战队过渡到空军有很多挑战，但海军陆战队的口号“即兴发挥、适应和克服”帮助他们取得了成功。当艾莉森准备退休时，她希望下一代的飞行员像她一样渴望学习。她在空军服役于四个不同的职业领域。她说：“每个飞行员都有东西要分享，有人要教，有人要学――都是有意的。”。军队面临着某些挑战，开放的学习态度是至关重要的。“不要相信你会因为太有经验而不能学到新东西，”她继续说。“正如俗话所说，不要以封面来判断一本书，不要以军衔来判断一个飞行员。我们每个人的袖子上都有一个故事。”

150,30 years- The Craver story,"MILFORD, Ohio - It's said that sports are games of inches ... Small bits of space, land or air that change the entire course of the game and the lives of those who play it. Whether it's a touchdown pass that soars a half-inch from a receiver's hands, a baseball landing just outside the chalk of a foul line or a runner edging out the competition to win a gold medal by hundredths of a second, the smallest of measurements can be life changing.

Many sports fans often refer to the ""game of inches"" phrase when reflecting on their lives. For one Ohio sports fan in particular, his entire life changed with .03 of a point, redirecting his life as a college student to become an Airman and after 30 years of service, retire as a chief master sergeant.

A farm boy from the small town of Milford, Ohio, Chief Master Sgt. Jeffrey Craver, 4th Fighter Wing command chief, always aspired to graduate from college and work in the civilian workforce. He saved enough money to fund one year of college and before his sophomore year, earned a merit scholarship to finance the remaining years. In order to keep his scholarship, he had to maintain a 3.0 grade point average. However, bad choices and poor prioritization through the coming months dropped his GPA to a 2.97, .03 points below the cutoff and, without any financial backing, ended his college tenure.

""It was really discouraging,"" Craver said. ""I worked a couple of odd jobs to try and find a path back to school. I made some poor decisions and wanted to get back on my own accord.""

Discouraged but determined, Craver, with advice from his father, found his way to an Air Force recruiter's office. With the goal of qualifying for the G.I. Bill, the 23-year old casually told the recruiter, ""I'll give you four years.""

That was March 1986.

Now, 30 years later, Craver will retire following a stint as command chief at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina.

""I'm walking away after 30 years with a lifetime of experience and memories,"" he said. ""I've got my education under my belt and it's afforded me a pretty good lifestyle.""

That lifestyle took him all over the world as he spent 23 of his 30 years overseas in places like Korea, Japan, Italy, Canada and his first duty assignment in Germany where he met his wife Kelley. Together, they raised a family of three daughters, Jessie, Sarah and Cheryl, and traveled the world, taking advantage of opportunities afforded to them with each duty assignment to meet people and make memories.

""I feel that military experience as a whole has truly shaped who we are today,"" Kelley said. ""His career took our family overseas for [most years] out of his 30. Being immersed in all of those different cultures is an experience that not many families get to share. It taught us to value time over anything else - appreciating the time we had with our extended family in America while also taking advantage of the time we had to explore the world.""

The chief shared his wife's sentiment and said the Air Force gives everyone a lot of opportunities, the decision and motivation is on the individual to go out and be successful. Through the years, the Cravers said they met so many different types of people, making them better citizens and for the chief, allowed him to 'grow up.'

Craver said he's 'grown up' wearing the Air Force uniform. Upon enlisting, he gained a new family and saw his growth begin during basic training at then Lackland Air Force Base, Texas.

""The first time you put that uniform on, it was incredible the reaction of everyone,"" he recalled. ""People were standing a little bit taller. That feeling of being part of an organization that's bigger than yourself, that has a tremendous mission is just incredible.""

From that first moment of uniformity, Craver said the sense of community and the bond he felt was addicting and formed an inherent trust amongst members of the Air Force family. Throughout his career, Kelley said he's still the same man she met so many years ago in Germany.

""What drew me to him was his character,"" she said. ""He was thoughtful, caring, helpful, witty ... None of that has changed over the years. Who he is hasn't changed. He has always been the incredible man he is today.""

The chief often recounts a story of when he was a freshly minted technical sergeant at Misawa Air Base, Japan as a turning point in his professional growth and cementing the character his wife so proudly proclaims.

Nervously stuck in a meeting full of commanders, chaired by the current wing commander, Craver recalled what was supposed to be a simple update briefing turned into a discussion about the Airmen on the base and how commanders could help those Airmen.

From that point on, he focused even more attention to caring for the Airmen he met, as well as their families and in turn, has received the same from his leadership.
""There were people who deliberately invested in me and gave me opportunities,"" Craver said. ""They were always there to catch me if I fell. I've tried to do that along the way. Airmen sometimes come back and say 'Thanks for being there, thanks for listening.' It's the little things that happen along the way that makes us stronger as a community and as an organization.""

Looking back on the past 30 years, the chief said it's bittersweet but he and Kelley are looking forward to new challenges. With a career filled with ups and downs, he said he has no regrets as he has nothing but memories he wants to remember.

""Because of advancements and technology, we'll look back and stay connected with the Air Force family as we reconnect with immediate family we've been separated from,"" he said. ""I'm proud, sad, scared, and anxious. It's a roller coaster of emotions but at the same time, it's time to go and I'm 100 percent assured that when I step aside, someone else will step up. That's what our nation expects us to do and that's what will happen.""

With several job leads, the Craver family now points their compass toward Ohio, back where it all began for the once farm boy with college aspirations.

""It's been a fantastic ride,"" Craver said. ""It's been our honor, duty and privilege to serve in this capacity and look forward to what life has next for us.""",2016/1/15,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/186535/30-years-craver-story,"MILFORD, OH, UNITED STATES",[],[],米尔福德，哦，美国,30年-领结者的故事,米尔福德，俄亥俄州-据说体育运动是英寸的游戏。。。一小块空间、土地或空气改变了游戏的整个过程和玩家的生活。无论是从接球员手上飞出半英寸的触地传球，还是在罚球线外的棒球落地，还是在比赛中以百分之一秒的优势赢得金牌的跑步者，最小的测量值都可能改变生活。许多体育迷经常提到“英寸游戏”反思他们的生活时使用的短语。特别是对一位俄亥俄州的体育迷来说，他的整个生活发生了0.03分的改变，他把自己作为一名大学生的生活重新定位为一名飞行员，在服役30年后，作为一名军士长退休。一名来自俄亥俄州米尔福德小镇的农场男孩，军士长杰弗里・克雷弗中士，第四战斗机联队指挥长，一直渴望从大学毕业并在平民劳动力中工作。他存了足够的钱供一年的大学学习，在大二之前，他获得了一份优秀奖学金以资助余下的几年。为了保住奖学金，他必须保持平均3.0分的成绩。然而，在接下来的几个月里，糟糕的选择和糟糕的优先顺序使他的平均绩点下降到了2.97，比截止分数低了0.03个百分点，并且在没有任何财政支持的情况下，结束了他的大学任期。“这真是令人沮丧，”克雷弗说。“我做了几份零工，试图找到一条回学校的路。我做了一些糟糕的决定，想自己主动回去。”克雷弗沮丧但下定决心，在父亲的建议下，找到了一条去空军招募人员办公室的路。为了获得G.I.法案的资格，这位23岁的年轻人漫不经心地对招聘人员说：“我给你四年。”那是1986年3月。现在，30年后，克雷弗在北卡罗来纳州西摩约翰逊空军基地担任指挥长后将退休。“30年后，我将带着一生的经验和记忆离开。”他说。“我接受了良好的教育，这给了我一种非常好的生活方式。”这种生活方式让他走遍了世界各地，30年中的23年他都在韩国、日本、意大利、加拿大等地度过，他在德国的第一次任务就是在那里遇到他的妻子凯利。他们一起养育了一个由杰西、莎拉和谢丽尔三个女儿组成的家庭，并周游世界，利用每一次任务赋予他们的机会与人们见面并留下回忆。“我觉得整个军事经历真正塑造了我们今天的样子，”凯利说。“他的职业生涯使我们的家庭在海外度过了[大多数年]他30岁出头。沉浸在所有这些不同的文化中是一种很少有家庭能够分享的经历。它教会我们珍惜时间胜过一切――珍惜与美国大家庭在一起的时间，同时也利用我们探索世界的时间。”这位酋长与妻子分享了他的感受，并说空军给了每个人很多机会，决定和动机取决于个人走出去并取得成功。这些年来，领结者们说他们遇到了很多不同类型的人，使他们成为更好的公民，对酋长来说，这让他“长大了”。领结者说，他穿着空军制服“长大了”。入伍后，他获得了一个新的家庭，并在当时德克萨斯州拉克兰空军基地的基础训练中开始成长。“你第一次穿上那套制服时，每个人的反应都令人难以置信，”他回忆道。“人们站得更高了一点。作为一个比你更大的组织的一部分，有着巨大使命的感觉是难以置信的。”从统一的第一刻起，克雷弗说，他感到的社区感和纽带让人上瘾，并在空军大家庭成员之间形成了一种内在的信任。凯利说，在他的整个职业生涯中，他还是多年前在德国遇到的那个人。“吸引我的是他的性格，”她说。“他考虑周到、关心他人、乐于助人、机智机智……这些年来都没有改变。他是谁也没有改变。他一直是今天这个令人难以置信的人。”这位酋长经常讲述他在米萨瓦空军基地担任新技术中士时的故事，日本是他职业成长的转折点，巩固了他妻子自豪地宣称的性格。他紧张地参加了由现任联队指挥官主持的一个满是指挥官的会议，克雷弗回忆说，原本应该是一次简单的更新简报，后来变成了一次关于基地飞行员以及指挥官如何帮助这些飞行员的讨论。从那时起，他更加关注照顾他遇到的飞行员以及他们的家人，反过来，他的领导层也给予了同样的关注。“有些人故意投资于我，给了我机会，”克雷弗说，“如果我摔倒了，他们总是在那里抓住我。”。我一路上都试着这么做。飞行员有时会回来说‘谢谢你们的光临，谢谢你们的聆听。’正是在途中发生的一些小事让我们作为一个社区和一个组织变得更加强大。“回顾过去30年，科长说这是苦乐参半，但他和凯利都期待着新的挑战。他说，他的职业生涯充满了起起落落，他没有遗憾，因为他只有他想要记住的记忆。“由于技术进步，我们将回顾过去，与我们分离的直系亲属保持联系。”他说。“我感到骄傲、悲伤、恐惧和焦虑。这是情绪的过山车，但与此同时，是时候离开了，我百分之百确信，当我离开时，其他人会站出来。这是我们国家期望我们做的，也将发生的事。”有了几位工作领导，克雷弗一家现在将他们的指南针指向俄亥俄州，回到这个曾经有着大学抱负的农家男孩的起点，“这是一次奇妙的旅程，”克雷弗说。“能够以这样的身份服务并期待下一步的生活，这是我们的荣誉、责任和特权。”
151,Meyer assumes command of VX-30,"Cmdr. Paul “Oscar” Meyer relieved Cmdr. Christopher “Dot” Dotson as commanding officer of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron (VX) 30 during a change of command ceremony at Naval Base Ventura County Point Mugu, California, on June 13.

“I am always astonished,” Meyer said upon taking command, “at how many times I get asked the question: What does VX-30 do anyway?”

He went on to note that VX-30’s subdued patch includes a Latin inscription that, loosely translated, reads: If I told you, I’d have to kill you.

“I promise that’s not a threat of corporal punishment after the ceremony,” 
Meyer said before taking some time to give the audience an idea of the many types of critical missions VX-30 supports on a daily basis. They operate uniquely modified aircraft supporting military missions on the 36,000 square mile Point Mugu Sea Range and around the world. They operate manned and unmanned systems, test software and electronic warfare systems, and offer logistics support for test and evaluation operations, just to name a few. 

“Although I’ve described such a complex and diverse team, we are united by our mission,” he said. “So if I told you [more], our potential adversaries might gain what the Navy is trying our hardest to defend.”

Meyer, a native of Zion, Illinois, joined the “Bloodhounds” of VX-30 in November 2017, when he reported as chief test pilot for the squadron. He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2001 with a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering. He has since earned graduate degrees in systems engineering from the Naval Postgraduate School and National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College.

Meyer began his naval aviation career as an E-2 pilot; his first operational assignment brought him to Point Mugu, California, as a “Sun King” with Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 116. He graduated U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in 2009, and led the initial E-2D sea trials aboard USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), where he completed the first arrested landing and catapult launch of the new aircraft.

The ceremony also marked Dotson’s retirement after 21 years in the U.S. Navy.

Guest speaker Capt. Jason Rider, chief of staff for the Program Executive Office Air Anti-Submarine Warfare, Assault, and Special Mission Programs, praised Dotson’s flexibility and ability to get things done.

“I think of him as ‘plug-and-play,” Rider said. “It’s a hell of a thing to look at someone and know that no matter what assignment, what job you give him, he’ll handle it.”

Dotson praised Rider as a mentor and a friend.

“Thank you for teaching me that when it comes to leadership, there’s nothing more important than a strong command climate, and nothing more important than taking care of your people,” Dotson said.

Dotson, a native of New Castle, Pennsylvania, graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and was commissioned in the U.S. Navy through the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps in 1998. He graduated U.S. Navy Test Pilot School in 2005, and served as the MQ-4C Triton government flight test director of the System Development and Demonstration Integrated Test Team. He subsequently led engineering development and airworthiness certification efforts for the Triton ACAT-ID Program. He reported to VX-30 as chief test pilot in 2016 and took over as commanding officer in 2017.

VX-30 enables expeditious delivery of effective and sustainable integrated warfare capabilities to our Navy, Marine Corps, and joint warfighters. VX-30 also provides worldwide support of test range surveillance, clearance, air intercept control, telemetry, logistics, aerial refueling, airborne threat systems, and photometric data collection.

The VX-30 team is comprised of talented active duty, civil service, and contractor personnel operating a diverse inventory of manned aircraft and unmanned aircraft systems including the P-3C Orion, KC-130T Hercules and RQ-23A Tigershark.",2019/6/13,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/327902/meyer-assumes-command-vx-30,"POINT MUGU, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州穆古角,迈耶接受VX-30的命令,6月13日，在加利福尼亚州穆古市文图拉县海军基地举行的换届仪式上，保罗・迈耶中校接替克里斯托弗・多特森中校担任空中测试和评估中队（VX）30的指挥官。迈耶在接受命令时说：“我总是感到惊讶。”，“有多少次我被问到这样一个问题：VX-30到底有什么用？”他接着指出，VX-30的《被制服的补丁》中有一个拉丁文铭文，松散地翻译为：如果我告诉你，我就必须杀了你。“我保证仪式后不会有体罚的威胁。”迈耶在花一些时间让观众了解VX-30每天支持的多种关键任务之前说。他们操作独特的改装飞机，支持36000平方英里的穆古岬海区和世界各地的军事任务。他们操作有人和无人系统、测试软件和电子战他说：“尽管我描述了这样一个复杂多样的团队，但我们的使命使我们团结在一起。因此，如果我告诉你（更多），我们潜在的对手可能会得到海军正在尽力捍卫的东西。”迈耶是伊利诺伊州锡安人，加入了“猎犬队”2017年11月，他担任VX-30中队的首席试飞员。2001年，他从美国海军学院毕业，获得了航空航天工程学士学位。此后，他获得了海军研究生院系统工程研究生学位和海军战争学院国家安全与战略研究生学位e、 迈耶以e-2飞行员的身份开始了他的海军航空生涯；他的第一次作战任务将他带到加利福尼亚州的穆古角，作为航母空中预警中队（VAW）116的“太阳王”。他于2009年毕业于美国海军试飞员学校，并在“哈里・S・杜鲁门”号航母（CVN 75）上领导了最初的e-2D海上试飞仪式还标志着多特森在美国海军服役21年后退休。特邀演讲人、项目执行办公室空中反潜战、攻击和特殊任务项目办公室主任杰森・莱德上尉赞扬了多特森的灵活性和灵活性完成事情的能力。莱德说：“我认为他是‘即插即用’。看着一个人，知道不管你给他什么任务，什么工作，他都会处理，这是一件非常糟糕的事情。”多森称赞莱德是一位导师和朋友。“感谢你教会我，在领导方面，没有什么比强大的指挥氛围更重要，也没有什么比照顾你的员工更重要。”Dotson说，Dotson，宾夕法尼亚纽卡斯尔人，毕业于圣母大学电气工程学士，1998年通过海军预备役军官训练队在美国海军服役，2005毕业于美国海军试飞学校，并担任MQ-4C Triton政府飞行员。系统开发和演示集成测试团队的ht测试总监。他随后领导了Triton ACAT-ID项目的工程开发和适航认证工作。他于2016年向VX-30报告，担任首席测试飞行员，并于2017年接任指挥官。VX-30可快速交付有效的susta我们的海军、海军陆战队和联合作战人员不具备综合作战能力。VX-30还提供全球范围内的靶场监视、清障、空中拦截控制、遥测、后勤、空中加油、空中威胁系统和光度数据收集支持。VX-30团队由有才能的现役、民用服务人员组成ice和承包商人员操作各种载人飞机和无人飞机系统，包括P-3C猎户座、KC-130T大力神和RQ-23A虎豹。
152,Anchoring the Deck Plates for 30 Years,"“Flight quarters, flight quarters, all hands man your flight quarters stations.” As orders are passed across the ship’s one main circuit (1MC), Sailors in Air Department scramble to gather personal protective gear, and prep for the days’ work on the flight deck of the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis (CVN 74). 

	As Sailors transit the passageways to the flight deck, a lone yellow shirt peeks out of an office. Shaking hands and speaking words of motivation, Master Chief Aviation Boatswain’s Mate Jack Hudson, a Sailor that has given more than 30 years to the Navy, 13 of those years served aboard John C. Stennis, prepares to start his day.

	One would ask, “why 30 years?” The answer comes without hesitation and no sense of regret or lost time is seen through the facial expressions of Hudson as he answers. 

	“I think it’s the Sailors and the way they grow with you, I see them every day and I love helping them,” said Hudson. “Going on deployments, seeing the world and getting the wonderful feeling how you have helped people, by seeing the joy on their face, makes the time worth it.”

	When you look at a career the way Hudson does, waking up early and spending long periods of time away from family to fulfill a greater purpose isn’t a chore; it is a piece of him, something that defines the man he has become, and something that instills a sense of pride that is contagious.

	Time spent at sea is a sacrifice, one that is felt by both the Sailors and the Navy family that gives up birthdays, holidays, and special moments in life to support a career they may not fully understand. 

	“Make sure you take care of your families first, and then give your 100 percent every day on the ship and to the Navy,” said Hudson. “It is tough going away for deployments, and the biggest thing is communication.”

“When I’m at home I try to be easy going with the family,” said Hudson. “Sometimes Master Chief Hudson comes out of me when I’m at home with the kids, but when I’m home I love to clean, I like to make my wife happy and do those things for her and the kids.”

	Mentorship and genuine care for the Sailors that serve with Hudson is the driving force that keeps him going daily. Every day moments, from material condition hour (MCH) to taps, Hudson makes sure the junior and senior Sailors that serve aboard John C. Stennis know that he cares about them.

	“During cleaning stations I try to go around to each division, walk through all the berthings each day and talk to the Sailors,” said Hudson. “I’ll ask them what their plan is going into port, what they like to do on their off time and how their families are. I always remember a face or a name and where they’re from.”

	Looking back at the journey that started back in the small town of Mexico, Missouri, Hudson has kept the same values to this day. Taking care of others, respect, and just plain being nice, permeates through his personality.

	“I was a junior in high school, and the Navy recruiter called me and asked how much money I made an hour,” said Hudson. “At the time I was making $3.35 an hour and he told me the lowest paying job in the Navy pays $6.95 an hour, so I asked him when can I come down and see him. I went down there and I left that small town of about 11,000 people and went into the Navy.”

	 “Ask the Chief,” is a phrase used throughout the Navy and one that each Chief is taught from day one of selection. Hudson lives it daily, it is all he knows. Helping others, mentoring and developing those around him to one day take his place is evident in the lives he has impacted aboard John C. Stennis. You never know when someone will have such a profound impact on your career and life, and for Master Chief Navy Career Counselor Melissa Warren, that moment came early in her career.

	 “He provided me an opportunity to work as the air department career counselor as an Aviation Boatswain’s Mate (Equipment) 1st Class, and that has completely changed my entire career,” said Warren. “I don’t think that I would be where I am today had he not seen potential in me, and given me an opportunity to do something that I was better suited to do to support the Navy.”

	Those moments may seem small at the time, but can have a lasting effect on people, and carrying that experience and mentorship to where she is now has helped Warren to be the person she is today.

	“Part of being in the Chiefs Mess is comradery, development, and mentorship, and Master Chief Hudson has been all of that to everyone in the mess for 13 years,” said Warren. “The countless number of people that have gone to him for mentorship or guidance, training and development has been immeasurable. He’s kind of been like a big father to everybody, with his mellow demeanor and approachability; he truly is one of a kind.”

	For all Sailors, their career will come to an end. Whether moving on after the first term or completing a 30-year career, looking forward to the life beyond the Navy is something every Sailor will one day do. Taking the experiences, relationships and memories with him will be something Hudson will hold near and dear to his heart. 

	“I’m going to miss the Navy very much,” said Hudson. “I’ve been in for three quarters of my life and I love the John C. Stennis, it has been the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me. I’m going to take some time off. I plan on working in the Bremerton area, and I want to give back to the community as much as possible.”

	Even though a sense of sadness may linger along the passageway affectionately known as Jack Hudson Boulevard after he retires, the Chiefs Mess, Wardroom and Sailors of John C. Stennis will all take something from Hudson as the mission continues.

	“I don’t think people truly understand how much sacrifice is involved with a 30-year career,” said Warren. “For everything he and his family have sacrificed, I just want to say ‘Thank you’.”

153,30 Soldiers Train for Overseas Deployment,"The Oregon Army National Guard’s 1186th Military Police Company, based in Salem and Hood River, Oregon, is scheduled to deploy approximately 30 Soldiers to Afghanistan in support of Operation Freedom’s Sentinel (OFS). The Soldiers were selected for a special mission to provide a Personal Security Detail (PSD) for the International Security Assistance Force in support of the theater operational commander and other high profile personnel.

The Military Police (MP) Soldiers spent their three-week annual training in May 2017 at Camp Rilea, near Warrenton, Oregon, working on warrior tasks, battle drills, combat life saver training, weapons qualification, and then focused on specific training for their PSD mission.

The Oregon Army National Guard’s Pre-Mobilization Training Assistance Element (PTAE), a team of eight Soldiers that have experience from prior deployments, conducted the training at Camp Rilea.

“We’ll work with units ahead of time to create a package of training suited to the unit’s specific mission,” said Sgt. Nick Wolchesky, an instructor with the PTAE.

The training is fresh on the mind of one Soldier who recently graduated from Military Police training and was completing her first annual training.

“I’m the newest add for the deployment,” said Pvt. Alex Broussard, an MP with the 1186th MP Co. “I look forward to going to a new country with my unit and look forward to the experience I’m going to gain.”

More than half of the Soldiers deploying on this mission have previously deployed. The 1186 MP Company deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 and to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in 2004. The unit also provided domestic operations support in Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

For Sgt. Robert Frey, a team leader with the 1186th MP Co., this will be a return trip to Afghanistan and a chance to build on his past deployment experiences.

“I’ve been doing this for 11 years and look forward to going back to Kabul,"" said Frey. “It’s a NATO environment and you work beside military units from around the world.”

The veteran Soldiers have deployed as base security as well as jail security elements, but PSD is a new type of mission for them. 

“As a small platoon we have to cross-train and adapt to each job,” said Capt. Richard Smith, who will command the 1186th platoon while deployed. “This job is 100 percent paranoia; watching your sector and your buddies, keeping your situational awareness up at all times.”

Several Soldiers received PSD training prior to the annual training at Camp Rilea and were able to help mentor the other Soldiers. The annual training was a chance for the deploying platoon to work through real world situations based on current tactics and in-country social norms. The platoon of Soldiers was able to work through many situations in a training environment that included the surrounding towns near Camp Rilea.

“If we didn’t have this training prior to mobilizing, we wouldn’t be as bonded,” said Spc. Jacob Labato, a driver with the 1186th MP Co. “PSD is brand new to me and this has been a crash course on PSD.”

The 1186th MP’s are no strangers to tough training scenarios. In August 2015, the 1186th MPs spent 12 days conducting live-fire exercises and simulated battle scenarios at the National Training Center (NTC), in the Mojave Desert at Fort Irwin, Calif.

The unit also partners with local law enforcement agencies for training. They recently partnered with district and federal agencies to provide security, crowd management and traffic control during the 58th Presidential Inauguration, January 18-22, 2017, in Washington, D.C. 

The unit is scheduled to complete additional pre-deployment training at Fort Bliss, Texas, before deploying overseas.",2017/5/18,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/236107/30-soldiers-train-overseas-deployment,"SALEM, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国塞勒姆,30名士兵接受海外部署训练,位于俄勒冈州塞勒姆和胡德河的俄勒冈州陆军国民警卫队第1186宪兵连计划向阿富汗部署约30名士兵，以支持“自由行动哨兵”（OFS）。这些士兵被选中执行一项特殊任务，为国际安全援助部队提供个人安全细节（PSD），以支持战区作战指挥官和其他高层人员。2017年5月，宪兵（MP）士兵在俄勒冈州沃伦顿附近的Rilea营进行了为期三周的年度训练，从事战士任务、战斗演习、战斗救生员培训、武器鉴定，然后专注于PSD任务的具体培训。俄勒冈州陆军国民警卫队动员前培训援助分队（PTAE）是一支由8名士兵组成的团队，他们具有先前部署的经验，在Rilea营地进行了培训。“我们将提前与部队合作，制定一套适合部队具体任务的训练方案，”PTAE讲师尼克・沃尔切斯基中士说。一名刚从宪兵训练中毕业并正在完成第一次年度训练的士兵对这种训练记忆犹新。“我是这次部署的最新成员，”1186 MP公司的议员亚历克斯・布鲁萨德（Alex Broussard）说，“我期待着和我的部队一起去一个新的国家，期待着我将获得的经验。”在此次任务中部署的士兵中，有一半以上此前已经部署。1186 MP连于2011年部署到阿富汗，并于2004年部署到古巴关塔那摩湾。2005年卡特里娜飓风过后，该部队还为路易斯安那州提供了国内作战支持。对于1186 MP公司的队长罗伯特・弗雷中士来说，这将是一场战争埃图恩访问了阿富汗，这是一个在他过去的部署经验基础上发展的机会。“我已经这样做了11年，期待着回到喀布尔，”弗雷说。“这是一个北约环境，你和来自世界各地的军事单位一起工作。”老兵们被部署为基地保安和监狱保安，但PSD对他们来说是一种新型任务。“作为一个小排，我们必须交叉训练，适应每项工作，”理查德・史密斯上尉说，他将在部署时指挥1186排。“这份工作是100%的偏执狂；观察你所在的部门和你的伙伴，时刻保持你的态势感知。”几名士兵在Rilea营地接受年度训练之前接受了PSD训练，能够帮助指导其他士兵。年度训练是部署排根据当前战术和国内社会规范在现实世界中工作的一个机会。士兵排能够在许多情况下工作培训环境包括Rilea营地附近的周边城镇。“如果我们在动员之前没有接受过这种培训，我们就不会那么团结，”1186 MP公司的司机Spc.Jacob Labato说。“PSD对我来说是全新的，这是PSD的速成课程。”1186名议员对艰难的训练场景并不陌生。2015年8月，1186名议员花了12天时间在国家训练中心（NTC）进行实弹演习和模拟作战场景该单位还与当地执法机构合作进行培训。他们最近与地区和联邦机构合作，在2017年1月18日至22日华盛顿特区第58届总统就职典礼期间提供安全、人群管理和交通管制。该单位计划在在海外部署之前，在德克萨斯州布利斯堡进行额外的部署前培训。
154,The Highlanders celebrate 30 years of glory,"CAMP PENDLETON, Calif. - Every year around midsummer, about midday, you can spot an arguably peculiar event beginning to form up in the thick grassy plains and dirt roads leading from the Los Pulgas area of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, Calif.

Down the path the entire 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, led by a bagpiper, comes marching in a scene reminiscent of the Royal Scots Fusiliers in the Great War as they head to Red Beach, an area used for the Marine Corps’ forte: amphibious operations and training. And when they get to the beach they begin to compete in games and feast in true warrior fashion.  

The tradition, known as the Highlander Games Warrior Night, was instituted in 1998 and corresponds with the Battalion’s anniversary. It pays homage to the traditions of the famous Scottish Soldiers of the past after whom the battalion is nicknamed, the Highlanders. 

To celebrate the battalion’s 30th Anniversary, festivities kicked off with a rededication ceremony highlighting the combat unit’s short but illustrious battle history.

During the precisely executed ceremony, Lt. Col. Christian M. Rankin, the battalion’s commanding officer, stood before a formation of the four companies that comprise his unit and attached the battle streamers the unit has earned to the battalion’s organizational colors.  

A bell rang in honor of the men who have lost their lives in service to their nation as part of the battalion.

“Today is about reflection C reflecting on our purpose, reflecting on our history, reflecting on those who came before us, and reflecting on the future,” stated Rankin as he addressed his men and the guest who attended the event.

He added that the annual time for reflection was not only to think about history and sacrifice, but also a way for his Marines and Sailors to feel a connection to the unit’s forefathers, and to define the obligation they have to those who will follow in their own footsteps. 

“Please think about this for a moment: if we as human beings C as Marines and Sailors C have no connection with or need for those who have come before us, and if we have no responsibility or obligation to those who come after us, then our personal and professional lives would have little meaning,” he said.

Shortly after the speech, the battalion formed up and moved out to the sound of bagpipes, marching approximately three miles to the beach, where they conducted several friendly competitions.

Games included grappling, a Humvee pull, tug-o-war, and the culminating event: the caber toss. During this event, a heavy pole is thrown for distance. 

After completing the games, the Marines and Sailors enjoyed a camaraderie-filled atmosphere around a bonfire while feasting on barbeque and listing to live music as played by a local Irish-Scottish-style rock band.",2015/7/1,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/169259/highlanders-celebrate-30-years-glory,"CAMP PENDLETON, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州彭德尔顿营地,高地人庆祝30年的荣耀,彭德尔顿营地，加利福尼亚州――每年仲夏前后，大约中午，你都可以在茂密的草地和土路上看到一个可以说是奇特的事件开始形成，从加利福尼亚州彭德尔顿海军陆战队基地的洛斯普加斯地区开始。沿着这条路，整个第一轻装甲侦察营都由风笛手带领，行进中的场景让人想起了一次大战中苏格兰皇家炮兵前往红海滩的情景，红海滩是海军陆战队的强项：两栖作战和训练。当他们到达海滩时，他们开始在游戏中竞争，并以真正的战士的方式享用盛宴。这一传统被称为“高地人游戏勇士之夜”（Highlander Games Warrior Night），始于1998年，与该营的周年纪念日相对应。它向过去著名的苏格兰士兵的传统致敬，该营的绰号是“高地人”。为了庆祝该营成立30周年，庆祝活动以一个重新奉献仪式开始，突出了该作战部队短暂但杰出的战斗历史。在这一精确执行的仪式上，该营指挥官克里斯蒂安・M・兰金中校，站在组成他的部队的四个连的编队前，将该部队赢得的战斗条幅贴在营的组织颜色上。一个钟声响起，向作为该营一员在为国家服务中牺牲的人们致敬。“今天是关于反思的――反思我们的目标，反思我们的历史，反思我们之前的人，反思未来。”兰金在向他的部下和参加活动的客人讲话时说。他补充说，每年反思的时间不仅是思考历史和牺牲，也是让他的海军陆战队和海军陆战队感受到与部队祖先的联系的一种方式，并确定他们对那些将追随自己脚步的人的义务。“请想一想：如果我们作为人类――作为海军陆战队和水手――与我们之前的人没有任何联系或需要，如果我们对我们之后的人没有责任或义务，那么我们的个人和职业生活就没有什么意义了，”他说，该营集结起来，随着风笛声出发，向海滩行进了大约三英里，在那里他们进行了几次友好的比赛。比赛包括格斗、悍马拉、拔河以及最重要的项目：抛卡伯。在这个项目中，一根沉重的杆子被抛到远处。比赛结束后，海军陆战队和水手们在篝火旁享受着充满同志情谊的气氛，同时享受烧烤，并观看当地爱尔兰-苏格兰风格摇滚乐队演奏的现场音乐。
155,A presence still felt for over 30 years,"SEYMOUR JOHNSON AIR FORCE BASE, N.C.―
The 336th Fighter Squadron hosted Maj. David Hook, 50th Flying Training Squadron instructor pilot, Columbus Air Force Base, Miss. and his wife at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina on July 9, 2021.
On September 30, 1990, David’s father, Maj. Peter Hook, unexpectedly passed away during an F-15E Strike Eagle crash in the Saudi Arabian desert while deployed for Operation Desert Storm. Years later, a family event was held at the fighter squadron, where 10-year-old David was in attendance and received his first coin.
The 336th FS named their heritage room after Peter to honor the loss of their fallen.
“As a kid, all I remember was standing in the heritage room in awe of who my father was and the legacy he left behind,” said Hook. “Being welcomed and shown such love after all these years still means the world to me today.”
Hook is now a pilot in the Air Force like his father, but flew the B1 Bomber and now is an T38 instructor pilot at Columbus AFB, MS. 
The 336th FS had requested to honor the loss of Peter by having his son fly in an F-15E out of the same place his father flew out of. 
“Being able to fly in the same airframe as my father left me speechless,” exclaimed Hook. “There are few really special days over an Air Force career and this is one of them,” he continued. “It gives me a renewed sense of appreciation and motivation for what I do now, teaching the next generation of world famous fighter and bomber pilots.”
Hook was able to go up and fly in an F-15E like his father used to.

156,Space Launch Delta 30 Change of Command,"Space Launch Delta 30 members welcomed their new commander during a change of command ceremony on June 11, 2021, at Vandenberg Space Force Base.

The formal change of command allows service members to see their new commander while preserving military tradition and boosting morale on base. It begins with the passing of the guidon, a brief relinquishing of command, and an assumption of command by the newly appointed commander.

Presiding over the ceremony was U.S. Space Force Lt. Gen. Stephen N. Whiting, commander of Space Operations Command.

“The Space Force is powered by innovation and Tony, you’ve done a superb job leading Vandenberg through the significant changes and challenges of the past two years. It took an extraordinary amount of effort to transition Vandenberg, one of the department’s largest installations and 30th Space Wing, in to Space Launch Delta 30, but your team made it look easy,” said Whiting. “In reality, even at the best of times large-scale organizational transformations are difficult. Add in the unique demands presented by a worldwide pandemic, and I think we can all agree that the accomplishments of Team Vandenberg are truly impressive.”

During his assignment, Col. Anthony Mastalir successfully responded to the current pandemic by vigorously promoting safety to include the ""Operation Fight Back"" COVID response campaign. Additionally, he witnessed the creation of the United States Space Force and Vandenberg's historic name change. He helped make history with the establishment of Space Launch Delta 30, within two years of assuming command. His priorities were: “Care, Execute, and Innovation.”

“Conditions had changed slightly. I found myself signing a public health emergency declaration and unbelievably signing a directive stating that you cannot shake each other’s hands. I vividly remember the rows of sewing machines lined up staffed by volunteers around the base. Anyone who knew how to sew active duty, civilians and dependents, it didn’t matter; and you came together and produced and distributed thousands of masks for our community, our base. When our supply channels were empty, we beat the pandemic because you chose to fight back,” said Mastalir.

Col. Robert A. Long, previously the deputy commander of Space Delta 5 at Vandenberg Space Force Base, assumed command from Mastalir.

“It’s been a special place since I first drove through the front gate 23 years ago. Over the years every service recognizes the strategic value of this gem over central California and each has contributed to its rich history. Yet our predecessors would likely marvel at the astonishing breath of combat power that is now resident in, generated by, protected from, Vandenberg Space Force Base,” said Long.  “To the men and women of Space Launch Delta 30, you are experts at generating and delivering combat power from this central California outpost and you have my commitment to expend every ounce of energy making sure you have the tools to succeed.”

The Space Launch Delta 30 mission is to provide robust, relevant, efficient range and spaceport capabilities for the nation. Vandenberg’s space lift and range operations support national and combatant commander requirements, in addition to supporting operational and development missile system testing for the Department of Defense. The SLD 30 commander is responsible for $8.4B in assets, a $280M annual budget, installations spanning more than 118,000 acres, and more than 11,000 military, civilian and contractor personnel.",2021/6/11,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/398766/space-launch-delta-30-change-command,"VANDENBERG SPACE FORCE BASE, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州范登堡航天部队基地,太空发射Delta 30改变指令,2021年6月11日，在范登堡航天部队基地举行的换帅仪式上，德尔塔30号航天发射队的成员欢迎他们的新指挥官。正式的换帅使服役人员能够看到他们的新指挥官，同时保持军事传统，提高基地士气。仪式开始于圭登号的通过、指挥权的短暂放弃，以及新任命的指挥官担任指挥。主持仪式的是美国航天部队太空作战司令部司令斯蒂芬・惠廷中将。“航天部队的动力来自创新，托尼，你在领导范登堡度过过去两年的重大变化和挑战方面做得非常出色。为了将该部门最大的设施之一、第30空间联队的范登堡过渡到空间发射三角洲30号，你付出了巨大的努力，但你的团队“这看起来很容易，”怀廷说。“实际上，即使在最好的时候，大规模的组织变革也很困难。再加上全球流行病带来的独特要求，我认为我们都可以同意，范登堡团队的成就确实令人印象深刻。”在任职期间，安东尼・马斯塔利尔上校通过大力促进安全，包括“反击行动”，成功应对了当前的大流行新冠肺炎应对运动。此外，他见证了美国航天部队的成立和范登堡的历史性更名。他在担任指挥职务的两年内，帮助建立了太空发射三角洲30号，创造了历史。他的首要任务是：“关心、执行和创新。”“情况稍有变化。我发现自己签署了一份公共卫生紧急声明，令人难以置信地签署了一份指令，声明双方不能握手。我清楚地记得基地周围排列着一排缝纫机，工作人员都是志愿者。任何知道如何为现役军人、平民和家属缝制衣服的人，我都不会忘记不要紧，你们走到一起，为我们的社区，我们的基地生产和分发了数千个面具。当我们的供应渠道空了，我们战胜了大流行，因为你们选择了反击。”马斯塔利尔上校罗伯特・A・朗（Robert A.Long）曾担任范登堡航天部队基地空间三角洲5号的副指挥官，他从马斯塔利尔接过指挥权。“自从23年前我第一次开车穿过前门以来，这里一直是一个特殊的地方。多年来，每一个军种都认识到这颗宝石在加州中部的战略价值，并且每一个军种都为其丰富的历史做出了贡献。然而，我们的前辈可能会对现在居住在加州的令人惊讶的战斗力感到惊讶y、 “范登堡太空部队基地受到保护，”朗说。“对于三角洲30号航天发射的男女来说，你们是从加利福尼亚中部前哨基地产生和输送战斗力的专家，我承诺你们将花费每一盎司的精力，确保你们拥有成功的工具。”空间发射Delta 30任务旨在为国家提供强大、相关、高效的射程和空间端口能力。范登堡的空间提升和射程操作支持国家和作战指挥官的要求，此外还支持国防部的作战和发展导弹系统测试。SLD 30 com曼德尔负责84亿美元的资产、2.8亿美元的年度预算、占地11.8万英亩的设施以及11000多名军事、文职和承包商人员。
157,30 Years of Service With her Navy Family,"It all started just before her 18th birthday when her father planted the idea of applying for a childcare job through then, Naval Station Bremerton’s Morale, Welfare & Recreation program in 1990.

Although she was preparing for her high school graduation, it only made sense to her, her father, and the friends she made on the base now known as Naval Base Kitsap. Her military bloodlines run deep, whether they were through active duty service or working as government civilians for the Bremerton naval shipyard.

And through the years, she’s made impacts on her customers, co-workers, and friends she’s made through her military ties. She calls them all her “Navy family.” 

Kristy Hugg, an MWR Operations Clerk for NBK, was presented a 30 Year Length of Service Award at Bangor Plaza May 18, but it wasn’t simply for her length of service. It was her continued professionalism, support, and friendship she lends to just about anyone she meets. 

“As a Navy spouse, in addition to her tenure with MWR, Kristy’s dedication to the fleet is without question,” wrote Erik Ruud, Navy Region Northwest Installation Program Manager for MWR and Felicia Kratzer, MWR Admin Officer. “She is often the link between guests and MWR services. Because of her dedication to the Navy, she has formed lasting friendships with Sailors and DoD employees that have spanned decades. It is not unusual to see senior chiefs, master chiefs, officers, and many former active duty Sailors, now working in the local area, return to Bangor Plaza, recognize Kristy, and begin to reminisce over the good old days.”

The letter by Ruud and Kratzer acknowledged Hugg’s length of service and her contributions throughout the years.

Hugg let the letter sink in, and when asked about it she shared her sentiments to the heartwarming words.

“Now that I really sit down and think about it, after they read the letter, it is true that I’ve met and made friends with certain customers that keep coming in over the years,” she said. “It’s so amazing to reflect over 30 yearsC so much has happened. I’ve watched different families kids grow up and then see them get married and have a family of their own. It’s beautiful. You have interactions with your customers and it makes you remember why you love working at your job.”

Hugg also said a lot of her personal life and work-life have come together due to the relationships she and her husband Tim Hugg built through work and their Navy family over the years. 

“I really couldn’t have asked for a better Navy family of friends and coworkers,” she said. “I really am appreciative of the people I work with. They’ve all been incredibly supportive and we’ve all worked with each other for so long that we all know each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and personalities we come together to be such a great team. We couldn’t do what we do without each other. We’re that family that will pull through anything together to get the job done.”

158,Michigan Returns to the PACNORWEST After 30 Months,"INDIAN ISLAND, Wash. (NNS) -- The Ohio-class guided-missile submarine USS Michigan (SSGN 727) returned home to the Pacific Northwest May 13, after being forward-deployed for 30-months in the Western Pacific.

Since its departure in December 2016, Michigan was forward-deployed to Guam, where it conducted surveillance, training and other critical missions in the 7th Fleet Area of Operation. 

""Both Michigan Blue and Gold crews worked tirelessly together, and with our maintenance partners from Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and the Guam-based submarine tenders Frank Cable and Emory S. Land, to keep an aging ship ready to fight at the tip of the spear in the Western Pacific,"" said USS Michigan Blue's commanding officer Capt. Bradley Terry. ""Keeping a submarine as complex as Michigan deployed for approximately 30-months is an extremely noteworthy accomplishment and demonstrates the remarkable skill, capability, and resiliency of our submarine Sailors and their families that support them.""

Michigan also worked with partners from the Republic of Korea Navy (ROKN) in Busan to build and maintain maritime partnerships. The rotating crews swapped seven times throughout the deployment. 

""We all have great reasons to be proud of the seven crews that have kept Michigan operationally deployed for nearly 30 months,"" said Capt. Christopher Kline, deputy commander, Submarine Squadron 19. ""This ships tremendous operational capability has been exercised in countless ways by extraordinary Sailors and has contributed significantly to the security of the U.S. and our Pacific partners in ways that few know. We welcome the ship and her crew back home with the confidence that the team is ready for all challenges as the ship enters their maintenance period.""

Both Michigan Gold and Blue crews received the 2018 Submarine Squadron 19 Battle Efficiency Award (Battle E) while forward deployed. The Battle ""E"" is an award of merit presented to the most proficient submarine crews in each squadron. This signifies Michigan's sustained superior technical performance and combat readiness throughout the year. 

""Both crews excelled in all mission areas and gained invaluable forward-deployed operating experience in the dynamic 7th Fleet area of operation, as well as offering leadership tremendous operational flexibility due to the versatility and capability of the SSGN platform,"" said Terry. ""However, as exciting as operating in the Western Pacific is, nothing beats returning home to the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  Both crews will now be focused on getting Michigan ready for a scheduled maintenance and modernization period in Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.""

The ship is scheduled to begin a Major Maintenance Period at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PSNS & IMF). Major Maintenance Periods are part of a ship's normal operating cycle and occur after the submarine has been forward deployed for over 12 months.

160,NIOC Pensacola Celebrates 30 Years of Operations,"By CTN1(IW/SS) Mark Jansson

PENSACOLA, Fla. (NNS) C Navy Information Operations Command (NIOC) Pensacola celebrated its 30th year of operations during a short ceremony held at Naval Air Station Pensacola-Corry Station on Oct. 6th. 

In 1982, it was recognized that the Naval Security Group would require a significant number of general purpose automated systems for field-station use. With the cost of computer hardware decreasing and software costs increasing at a dramatic pace, it became evident that a new approach to software support was required. Thus, the concept of an organization whose only mission was computer support was born.

In the fall of 1986, the authorization was granted by the Chief of Naval Operations to establish NSGD Pensacola, now known as NIOC Pensacola. A transition team was placed at Headquarters, Naval Security Group Command where planning and implementation efforts continued. Personnel started arriving in Pensacola in February 1987.

The event featured remarks from the current Commanding Officer of NIOC Pensacola, Cmdr. Paul D. Lashmet and the former officer in charge of Naval Security Group Detachment Pensacola, retired Capt. Tom Pigoski.

“We’re here today to celebrate the 30th birthday of Navy Information Operations Command, Pensacola; a beacon of Navy cyber operations excellence on Florida’s cyber coast,” said Lashmet. “Who would’ve guessed that a 17-person detachment conducting boutique software support for then Commander Naval Security Group would survive multiple rounds of site closures and grow to nearly 350 Sailors, civilians, and contractors conducting full-scope operations to defend our great nation against a myriad of adversaries around the world?” 

Pigoski followed with a chronological and personal summary of the events leading to the establishment of the Naval Security Group Detachment and the Navy cryptology ratings, showcasing the Civil War and World War II as cryptologic milestones. 

“Why are we here? How did we get here?  It took time! It started in the 1980’s, early 80’s. It was perseverance and help from a lot of organizations and a lot of different people to get to where we are today,” said Pigoski. 

NIOC Pensacola is now a subordinate command of U.S. Fleet Cyber Command and comprises Task Group 103 of the U.S. 10th Fleet.

U.S. Fleet Cyber Command serves as the Navy component command to U.S. Strategic Command and U.S. Cyber Command, and the Navy’s Service Cryptologic Component commander under the National Security Agency/Central Security Service. Fleet Cyber Command also reports directly to the Chief of Naval Operations as an Echelon II command.

U.S. 10th Fleet is the operational arm of Fleet Cyber Command and executes its mission through a task force structure similar to other warfare commanders. In this role, C10F provides operational direction through its Maritime Operations Center located at Fort George Meade Md., executing command and control over assigned forces in support of Navy or joint missions in cyber/networks, information operations, electronic warfare, cryptologic/signals intelligence and space.

161,Command chief retires after 30 years,"When young adults enter military service, they start on a path they will follow for years to come.

At the end of each enlistment term, they are faced with the decision to continue serving their country or begin a new journey.

In 1987, one young man began what he believed would only be one term as a weather forecaster in the Air Force, but his career ended up spanning 30 years of service.

On June 1, Chief Master Sgt. Christopher McKinney, former 20th Fighter Wing command chief, gathered with family and friends to mark the end of an era at his retirement ceremony.

He reflected on the lessons that did not come easily during his journey.

“A lot of times my thought processes were driven by ‘how is this going to benefit me,’” said McKinney. “Now many of my choices are ‘how does it benefit the Air Force, my unit, the people I supervise and my family.’”

As a leader, McKinney stressed the importance of getting to know the individuals around him. 

“You’ve heard me say it a million times if you’ve been around me for more than five minutes,” said McKinney. “People don’t care how much you know unless they know how much you care. When people don’t think we care, they shut off.”

One Airmen who felt impacted by McKinney’s efforts was his executive assistant, Tech. Sgt. Lester Powell.

“Chief connected with me immediately and anything I told him about myself, I never had to say twice,” said Powell. “He knew my interests, hobbies, goals, and family and regularly asked about each.  Not everyone realizes how far someone asking you about (yourself) can go.  That can make or break someone's day.”

By showing interest in those around him and caring for his Airmen, he fostered relationships which helped his team complete the mission.

“Why do I want to have relationships, why do I want to connect?” said McKinney. “Because with resource constraints, I have to get innovation from you. I don’t have all the answers. If I don’t connect to you, if I don’t learn to bridge that generational gap, I do not tap into the most precious resource (the Air Force has).”

The Air Force is made up of Airmen from diverse backgrounds, cultures and thought processes, so finding a way to connect is not always simple. It requires someone with a flexible mindset to process innovative ideas, the courage to say what needs to be said, and the ability to control and express their emotions, said McKinney. 

Even though he may not agree with someone, he said having mental agility, moral courage and emotional intelligence helps him listen and glean information he can use to make a connection. After a connection is made, the other person is more open to hearing a different opinion. It won’t change everything, but it is an opportunity to plant a seed. 

He planted some of those seeds in Powell’s mind by sharing his experiences and leadership style. 

“From day one, he began to pour knowledge and leadership traits into me,” said Powell. “Chief McKinney saw something in me that I did not even see in myself.  I was a young Tech. Sgt. and wanted to just sit back and coast for however long I was going to be stationed here at Shaw. Chief gave me a ‘seat at the table’ and afforded me the opportunity to change my view.”

Even with all he learned during his career, McKinney has advice he wishes he could have given himself, and all young Airmen, at the beginning of the journey.   

“If I had to give advice to Airman Basic McKinney I would say ‘McKinney, do more, better, before,’” he said. “Do more than they expect, better than they expect it, before they expect it. When you do those things, you become the go-to person. When you do those things, opportunities find you.”

Despite the advice he wish he received, his 30-year career was filled with experiences he never would have had without the Air Force, met one-of-a-kind people from across the world, and changed a few lives.

“There is no doubt that I am the NCO that I am today due to the mentorship and leadership (McKinney) has shown me over my seven months working under his direction,” said Powell. “Words cannot express how much that means to me.”

McKinney was a true example of what an American Airman, leader and warrior should be, said Powell, and expressed the desire to one day do for other Airmen as McKinney did for him.

Before his retirement, Chief McKinney reflected on his fellow Airmen and the impact they had on his career. 

“The last thing I will say to the men and women of Team Shaw and the 20th FW is, from the bottom of my heart, I love you my brothers and sisters in arms,” said McKinney. “Thank you for allowing me to be your teammate.”",2017/6/8,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/237110/command-chief-retires-after-30-years,"SHAW AIR FORCE BASE, SC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国南卡罗来纳州肖空军基地,司令30年后退休,当年轻人服兵役时，他们将踏上一条未来数年的道路。在每个征兵期结束时，他们面临着继续为国家服务或开始新的征程的决定。1987年，一名年轻人开始了他认为只有一个任期的空军气象预报员，但他的职业生涯结束了长达30年的服务生涯。6月1日，前第20战斗机联队司令克里斯托弗・麦金尼（Christopher McKinney）上士与家人和朋友在他的退休仪式上聚会，纪念一个时代的结束。他反思了在他的旅程中不容易得到的教训。“很多时候，我的思维过程都是由‘这对我有什么好处’来驱动的，”麦金尼说。“现在我的很多选择是‘这对空军、我的部队、我管理的人和我的家人有什么好处’。”作为一名领导者，麦金尼强调了了解身边的人的重要性。“如果你在我身边超过五分钟，你已经听我说过无数次了，”麦金尼说。“人们不在乎你知道多少，除非他们知道你有多在乎。当人们认为我们不在乎时，他们就会闭嘴。”麦克金尼的努力影响了一名飞行员，他的执行助理、技术中士莱斯特・鲍威尔（Lester Powell）说：“首席执行官立即与我取得联系，我告诉他关于我自己的任何事情，我都不必说两遍。”。“他了解我的兴趣、爱好、目标和家庭，并定期询问每一个人。不是每个人都知道有人问你（你自己）能走多远。这会影响到一个人的一天。”通过对周围的人表示兴趣并关心他的飞行员，他培养了关系，帮助他的团队完成了任务。“为什么我想建立关系，为什么我想联系？”麦金尼说。“因为资源有限，我必须从你那里获得创新。我没有所有的答案。如果我不与你联系，如果我不学会弥合代沟，我就不会利用最宝贵的资源（空军拥有）。”空军由来自不同背景、文化和思维过程的飞行员组成，因此找到联系的方法并不总是简单的。麦金尼说，这需要有灵活的思维方式来处理创新想法，有勇气说出需要说的话，并有能力控制和表达他们的情绪。尽管他可能不是他说，智力敏捷、道德勇气和情商有助于他倾听和收集可以用来建立联系的信息。建立联系后，对方更愿意听取不同的意见。这不会改变一切，但这是种下种子的机会鲍威尔说：“从第一天起，他就开始向我灌输知识和领导才能。”。“麦金尼警长从我身上看到了一些我自己都看不到的东西。我是一名年轻的技术中士。我想坐下来好好休息一下，不管我在肖军校待多久。警长给了我一个‘餐桌旁的座位’，让我有机会改变我的看法。”尽管他在职业生涯中学到了很多东西，但麦金尼还是提出了一些建议，他希望在旅程开始时能给自己和所有年轻的飞行员。他说：“如果我必须给飞行员基本麦金尼提建议，我会说‘麦金尼，在这之前做得更多更好’。”。“在他们期望之前，做得比他们期望的更多，比他们期望的更好。当你做这些事情时，你成为一个积极进取的人。当你做这些事情时，机会会找到你。”尽管他希望得到建议，但他30年的职业生涯充满了如果没有空军，他将永远不会有的经验，遇到了来自世界各地的独一无二的人，并改变了一些生活。“毫无疑问，我是今天的士官，这要归功于导师和领导（麦金尼）鲍威尔说：“我在他的指导下工作了七个月，这让我明白了。语言无法表达这对我有多重要。”鲍威尔说，麦金尼是一个真正的美国飞行员、领袖和战士的榜样，并表示希望有一天能像麦金尼为他所做的那样为其他飞行员做些什么。在退休前，麦金尼酋长反思了他的空军同伴以及他们对他职业生涯的影响。麦金尼说：“我最后要对肖队和第20届FW的男男女女说的是，从心底里说，我爱你们，我的兄弟姐妹们。谢谢你们让我成为你们的队友。”
162,SHEP's water impoundment nearly 30% complete,"Now almost 30 percent complete, the raw-water storage impoundment dike walls are currently four feet above ground level. With a circumference of two-thirds of a mile, they will be 29 feet high, encircle 17 acres and hold 97 million gallons of water when complete. 

As part of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project (SHEP) this water impoundment will be turned over to the City of Savannah as an additional source of municipal water supply to supplement water drawn from the city intake at Abercorn Creek. 

Constructing the impoundment dikes involves hauling in enough soil to fill 135 Olympic swimming pools, or a material volume of approximately 440,000 cubic yards. The effort will take 40,000 round-trip dump truck runs from borrow pits in the local area. 

The impoundment is part of the harbor deepening because the SHEP’s final report predicted deepening the harbor five additional feet would result in chloride increases near the city’s water intake. 

Since the increases would come from salt water moving further upstream, the increases in chloride would only occur at high tides during summer drought conditions. 

The Raw Water Storage Impoundment will mitigate the impact from increased chlorides. During periods of high tide and summer drought the city can suspend drawing water from Abercorn Creek and draw instead from the impoundment. 

After a few hours pass and tides recede, the city can begin drawing water again from Abercorn Creek and refill the impoundment. 

Building the impoundment is part of the $706 million harbor expansion project, known as the SHEP. 

Deepening the harbor from 42 to 47 feet will enable newer and larger container ships to call on the Garden City terminal with greater ease, heavier cargoes and fewer tidal restraints than they currently experience.",2016/9/13,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/209530/sheps-water-impoundment-nearly-30-complete,"PORT WENTWORTH, GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佐治亚州温特沃斯港,SHEP的蓄水已完成近30%,原水蓄水堤坝目前已完成近30%，高于地面4英尺。它们的周长为三分之二英里，建成后将高29英尺，占地17英亩，可容纳9700万加仑水。作为萨凡纳港扩建项目（SHEP）的一部分，该蓄水区将移交给萨凡纳市，作为城市供水的额外来源，以补充从Abercorn Creek城市取水口取水的水。修建蓄水堤坝需要运输足够的土壤，以填满135个奥运会游泳池，或大约440000立方码的材料体积。这项工作将需要40000辆自卸卡车从当地的取土坑来回行驶。蓄水是港口加深的一部分，因为SHEP的最终报告预测，港口再加深五英尺将导致城市取水口附近的氯化物增加。由于海水进一步向上游移动，氯化物的增加只会发生在夏季干旱条件下的涨潮时。原水蓄水将缓解氯化物增加的影响。在高潮和夏季干旱期间，城市可以暂停从Abercorn溪取水，而不是从蓄水池取水。几小时过去，潮水退去后，城市可以再次从Abercorn溪取水并重新蓄水。修建蓄水库是耗资7.06亿美元的港口扩建项目（即SHEP）的一部分。将港口从42英尺加深到47英尺，将使更新和更大的集装箱船能够比目前更轻松、更重的货物和更少的潮汐限制停靠花园城码头。
163,USS Nevada Reaches 30 Year Milestone,"BANGOR, Wash. (NNS) C The Blue and Gold crews of USS Nevada (SSBN 733) celebrated the ship's 30th anniversary with a ceremony at Naval Base Kitsap C Bangor, Aug. 12, 2016.

With this milestone, Nevada became the fourth active Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), and the third based in Bangor, to go beyond its originally planned 30-year service life.
 
""The age of the ship really makes our Sailors more important than ever,” said Cmdr. Gene Severtson, commanding officer of Nevada Gold. “The hard work of Nevada’s Sailors for the last 30 years has kept the ship in great material condition that lets us keep going out on patrol for months at a time.”

Current Ohio-class SSBNs are reaching the end of their life cycle.  When Nevada was commissioned on August 16, 1986, it had an anticipated service life of 30 years. However, the Ohio-class submarines lifetime has been extended from 30 to 42 years.

USS Henry M. Jackson (SSBN 730) was the first of the Ohio-classes to reach this service milestone in 2014, with USS Alabama (SSBN 731) following in 2015. 

“Quite frankly, this could have been a decommissioning ceremony,” said Rear Adm. John Tammen, commander of Submarine Group 9 who also served aboard Nevada early in his career. “Fortunately for the Navy and the country, our crews and maintenance teams have taken great care of the SSBN force over the years and today is a celebration of the next 12 years to come.”

The Navy's top priority is to ensure that the most survivable leg of our Nation's strategic nuclear triad remains fully resourced and ready through the existing SSBN force and continued development of the Ohio Replacement Program.

""We understand how important it is to keep accomplishing the strategic deterrent mission with this ship. The next generation of SSBNs are still in development and will not be in service until 2031,” said Severtson. “Now more than ever, it is imperative we keep this national treasure up and operating for the next 12 years.”
 
The celebration was sponsored by the Reno Navy League who has been an ardent supporter of the ship since its commissioning. “Over the last 30 years, they have come to every change of command and sponsored us on namesake visits,” said Severtson. “We’re thankful that they continue to provide us with a great connection to the state of Nevada.""

165,Gander veterans 30 years later- Not forgotten,"FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. C When Soldiers look back on American military history over the last century, most can recall famous wars like Vietnam, Operation Desert Storm or Operation Iraqi Freedom. Often times, the American public can forget about Soldiers who lost their lives not in battle nor in combat

On Dec. 12, 1985, Soldiers from 3rd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), Fort Campbell, boarded Arrow Airline flight 1285 to reunite with their families for the holidays, after a six-month peacekeeping mission in the Sinai, Egypt, but never made it home. 

Two-hundred-forty-eight Soldiers died when their plane crashed over Gander, Newfoundland.

The aftermath of this tragic event left an entire community in shock and a country mourning the loss of Soldiers

“I remember the sinking feeling when we were told the plane was confirmed as our flight,” said Jim Wassenaar, an infantryman with 3rd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd BCT. “The entire post was on auto pilot for a week or two after that day; everybody did their duties, but nobody seemed to know what was going on C it was a zombie land.”

“I remember when President Reagan did his speech; I could tell that he and Mrs. Reagan really felt our loss. When the cameras were off they wasn’t scared to let it show,” said the Worthington, Minnesota, native.

Over the years, Soldiers and families lost contact with each other and had to find ways to reconnect. 

“This group started when a few of us old 3-502nd Soldiers found each other in a Facebook group and we started talking about the memorial services around Fort Campbell,” said Wassenaar. 

Clarence Crawley, Jason Groff, Jim Titus, Joseph Sawtelle and I talked, and we decided that we should get as many of us as we can together, said Wassenaar.

What started out as conversation between four people quickly grew to a group of more than 320 Soldiers and family members. 

“I started a Facebook group for the purpose of getting as many of the Task Force 3-502nd personnel together to make an impact,” said Wassenaar.

The group has helped people not only reconnect with one another but has helped to recreate bonds.

“The group has helped us all to heal, many of us, including myself, thought that we were alone with the pain - that we had felt over the years,” said Wassenaar.

“After finding the group, we realized that we are not alone and we never will be again,” said Wassenaar.

As the 30th year anniversary approaches, the Gander veterans want to continue to tell their story.

“The community needs to know that the people we lost have not been forgotten,"" said Wassenaar.

“They’re remembered daily and they will be until the last person and or families involved are gone, as long as one of us is alive their memory will be alive with us.”",2015/11/4,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/180928/gander-veterans-30-years-later-not-forgotten,"FORT CAMPBELL, KY, UNITED STATES",[],[],坎贝尔堡，肯塔基州，美国,30年后的甘德老兵――没有被遗忘,肯塔基州坎贝尔堡―当士兵们回顾上个世纪的美国军事历史时，大多数人都会想起著名的战争，如越南战争、沙漠风暴行动或伊拉克自由行动。很多时候，美国公众可以忘记那些在1985年12月12日非战斗或战斗中丧生的士兵，坎贝尔堡101空降师（空袭）第502步兵团第2旅战斗队第3营的士兵登上阿罗航空公司1285航班与家人团聚过节，在埃及西奈半岛执行了六个月的维和任务后，他一直没有回家。248名士兵在飞机在纽芬兰的甘德坠毁时丧生。这一悲惨事件的后果使整个社区感到震惊，整个国家都在哀悼士兵的损失。“我记得当我们被告知飞机被确认为我们的航班时，有一种下沉的感觉，”第三营的步兵吉姆・瓦塞纳尔说，BCT第二团第502步兵团。“那天之后，整个岗位都在自动驾驶上呆了一两个星期；每个人都履行了自己的职责，但似乎没有人知道发生了什么――这是一片僵尸之地。”“我记得里根总统发表演讲时，我可以说他和里根夫人真的感到了我们的损失。当摄像机关闭时，他们并不害怕让它显示出来。”这位明尼苏达州的沃辛顿本地人说，多年来，士兵和家人失去了联系，不得不想办法重新联系。瓦森纳说：“当我们几个3-502老兵在一个Facebook群组中找到对方时，这个群组就开始了，我们开始谈论坎贝尔堡周围的纪念活动。”。“克拉伦斯・克劳利、杰森・格罗夫、吉姆・提图斯、约瑟夫・索特勒和我谈过，我们决定尽可能多地聚在一起，”瓦森纳说。起初，四个人之间的对话很快发展成一个由320多名士兵和家庭成员组成的团体。瓦森纳说：“我成立了一个Facebook小组，目的是让第3-502工作队的尽可能多的人员聚集在一起，产生影响。”该小组不仅帮助人们重新联系，还帮助人们重新建立了联系。瓦森纳说：“这个团体帮助我们所有人康复，我们中的许多人，包括我自己，都认为我们独自承受着多年来感受到的痛苦。找到这个团体后，我们意识到我们并不孤单，我们永远不会再孤单了。”随着30周年纪念日的临近，甘德老兵们希望继续讲述他们的故事。“社区需要知道我们失去的人没有被遗忘，”瓦森纳说。“他们每天都会被记住，直到最后一个人和/或家人离开，只要我们中的一个人还活着，他们的记忆就会与我们同在。”
166,Soldier marks 30 years during exercise,"FORT McCoy, Wis. ― Leaders and Soldiers of the 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, took a few minutes during one of their battle update briefs to recognize one of their own for reaching 30 years of active service to the Army and the nation.

“We want to take a few minutes to recognize one of our senior noncommissioned officers, who has faithfully led Soldiers for 30 years,” said Lt. Col. David Defelice, commander, 1st Squadron, 4th Cav. Regt., 1st Inf. Div. “He has dutifully performed every task the Army has ever asked him to do.”

Defelice was referring to his senior noncommissioned officer, Command Sgt. Maj. Patrick Frankenberg, who celebrated his 30th year of active-duty service Aug. 22 at Fort McCoy, during the squadron’s Combat Support Training Exercise 15-03.

Defelice, a native of East Haven, Connecticut, said Frankenberg made a positive impact on the Soldiers in the squadron and he was deeply honored to have served alongside him.

“Being in the field surrounded by the Soldiers and officers of the ‘Quarterhorse’ squadron is one of the best things I could ask for,” Frankenberg said. “This is probably one of the last major field exercises I will participate in, so it’s an honor to spend this time with my Soldiers.

Frankenberg said he was an “average” 17-year-old kid with a strong desire to become a policeman in his hometown of Las Vegas, but could not due to his age, so he walked into an Army recruiting office.

“When the recruiter told me I had to be at least 5 feet, 8 inches tall to become a military police officer, I was crushed,” Frankenberg said. “The only thing I had seen myself being was a police officer.”

Frankenberg said the recruiter had a video that might change his mind about what he wanted to do in the military.

“The video started slow; then you see an M1 Abrams tank moving very fast, hitting a small hill then jumping through the air over a small puddle of water,” Frankenberg said. “It was the coolest thing I had ever seen and I knew what I wanted to do that in the military.”

Frankenberg enlisted in the Army as an armor crewman.

On Aug. 23, 1985, he reported to Fort Knox, Kentucky, to begin his life of service in the military.

“Thirty years go by faster than you think,” Frankenberg said. “When I first enlisted, I never thought about making this a career, but each time I was a month away from ending my service, I would re-enlist for another four years.”

Frankenberg said it was a privilege to serve as a command sergeant major.

“Over the last few months, I’ve begun to reflect on my career,” Frankenberg said. “I get a little emotional, because I know my time [in the military] is coming to an end.”

Frankenberg said he had many memorable moments throughout his career, but the one that stuck out the most was one he shared during Operation Desert Shield/ Storm with Pfc. Richard Wells, the loader on his tank crew when he was a young sergeant.

“We were sitting in our tank when Wells shared his anxiety about spending his first Thanksgiving away from his family and friends,” Frankenberg said. “I told him most of the Soldiers here were away from family and friends, and not to worry because we are family now and none of us would ever be alone on another holiday.”

Frankenberg said taking care of Soldiers and their families was the thing he enjoyed the most.

“The thing I love most about being in the Army is being able to help Soldiers,” Frankenberg said. “I have tried to help Soldiers my entire career.”

“They have been there for me through the numerous deployments and it’s time for me to be there for them,” Frankenberg said.

Frankenberg said his retirement was still about a year away, so he would continue focusing on good order and discipline in the squadron. He said the most important information he could give to Soldiers and leaders was to be proud of the two name tapes that appear on their uniforms.

167,Chief Master Sgt. Dugger- A 30 Year Legacy,"After serving at 18 bases and receiving multiple awards for his exemplary service, Chief Master Sgt. Eric Dugger, 7th Bomb Wing command chief, reflected on his 30-year career and how it helped him become who he is today. 

As a young man going to the University of Pittsburg, Dugger struggled through school to become an engineer. With the unfinished classes pilling up after four years, he was unsure of what exactly the future held for him. 

“I was just a party-having, unfocused person trying to figure out what my life was going to be,” he recalled. “After looking at various options on what to do with my life, I talked with a friend about joining the Air Force. Shortly after, I began my journey as a services Airman.”

Dugger recalled the first thing he had to get used to is ‘the military life’ and what that encompassed. His only idea of military life came from the bits and pieces he saw on TV, with rigid discipline and plenty of yelling.
Despite the challenges thrown his way, he continued to work hard through it all and began his career in Kadena Air Base, Japan, as a food services apprentice. 

From then on, he learned more about the Air Force every day and what it truly means to be an Airman. Looking for guidance, he found it in Master Sgt. Ernest Davis, who became his first mentor. Knowing the first duty station is hard on a lot of Airmen far away from home, Davis invited him into his home every Sunday for dinner, giving him the opportunity to talk about life and find guidance in him. 

Dugger continued his career as a services Airman through many different assignments. He took on tasks such as food services, fitness center activities, mortuary affairs, and even UDM and first sergeant duties. He continued to strive for excellence and make the best of his career.
“Davis’ profound effect is one of the reasons I became a first sergeant,” said Dugger. “He took me in, he cared for me, and he showed me a senior leader has to bring in and cover their airmen. He was my foundation.”

On top of all this, there was still the ever-present struggle of balancing his life as an Airman and his home life. Trying to build support for his new family while so far from home was difficult, especially with the many duties he took on throughout his career.

“That’s one thing I think every Airman will struggle with,” said Dugger. “If you get married and you pull your spouse away from their support structure, how do you rebuild that for them? We didn’t know that back then. It was a struggle to work through Air Force life together, but communication truly helps.” 

Through first sergeant duties and other opportunities, he made great efforts to let others know he was ready to lend a helping hand. From helping Airmen get through classes for their Career Development Course training to dealing with a suicide of one his Airmen, Dugger wanted to be a friend to his Airmen more than anything. However, once he made Chief, the big question always loomed over him: what next? 

He recalled never planning on becoming a command chief. Upon a recommendation by a fellow chief, he strived for it as soon as his name was on the list. 

Arriving to Dyess in August of 2018 as the base’s command chief, Dugger’s primary focus outside of his usual duties was to go through different units on base to connect with Airmen. This helped Dugger let the Airmen know who he is and that he is someone to go to if they need something.

“The Airmen should know they have a command chief accessible to them at all times,” said Dugger. “The position of chief is only a servant, because I work for the Airmen. You want to be there, because if someone’s in a dark spot I would love to be the guy that they call.”

Through these relationships with Airmen across base, Dugger built up memories of a lifetime, not just for himself but for Airmen around him.

“He leads not from the mind but from the heart, the way he takes care of his people is genuine,” said Staff Sgt. Johanne Schaeffer, 7th BW command chief executive assistant. “He’s left a good mark on Dyess, and I think our job now is to continue that legacy.”

As he moves into the next chapter of his life, Dugger hopes to leave some words of wisdom for the Airmen of Dyess.

“Understand that you’re uncommon to the people of the United States,” said Dugger. “Not everyone raises their right hand and joins the world’s greatest Air Force, not everyone makes the same sacrifices and goes through the same difficulties that come with serving. It all comes down to three major things: understanding your career, build more relationships, and seek more job opportunities.”",2021/7/19,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/401210/chief-master-sgt-dugger-30-year-legacy,"DYESS AIR FORCE BASE, TX, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国德克萨斯州戴斯空军基地,达格军士长-30年的遗产,在18个基地服役并因其出色的服务而获得多个奖项后，第七轰炸联队司令埃里克・杜格尔上士反思了他30年的职业生涯，以及它如何帮助他成为今天的自己。作为一个年轻人去匹兹堡大学，达格努力奋斗成为一名工程师。四年后，由于未完成的课程越来越多，他不确定自己的未来究竟是什么。他回忆道：“我只是一个聚会上的人，没有集中注意力，试图弄清楚我的生活会是什么样子。”。“在研究了我生活中的各种选择之后，我与一位朋友谈论了加入空军的问题。不久之后，我开始了我作为一名空军勤务员的旅程。”杜格尔回忆说，他必须习惯的第一件事是‘军事生活’以及其中包含的内容。他对军事生活的唯一想法来自于他在电视上看到的点点滴滴，严格的纪律和大量的叫喊。尽管面临挑战，他仍然继续努力完成这一切，并在日本嘉手纳空军基地作为一名食品服务学徒开始了他的职业生涯。从那时起，他每天都在学习更多关于空军的知识，以及成为一名飞行员的真正意义。为了寻求指导，他在欧内斯特・戴维斯上士身上找到了答案，他成为了他的第一位导师。戴维斯知道第一个工作地点对许多离家很远的飞行员来说很困难，所以每个星期天都邀请他到家里吃晚饭，给他机会谈论生活并从中找到指导。Dugger通过许多不同的任务继续他的空军服役生涯。他承担了诸如食品服务、健身中心活动、停尸房事务，甚至UDM和上士职责等任务。他继续追求卓越，充分利用自己的职业生涯。“戴维斯的深远影响是我成为一名上士的原因之一，”达格说。“他带我进去，他关心我，他告诉我一个高级领导人必须带上和盖住他们的飞行员。他是我的基金会。”除此之外，仍然存在着一个平衡他作为一个飞行员和他的家庭生活的斗争。在离家这么远的时候，试图为他的新家庭建立支持是很困难的，尤其是他在整个职业生涯中承担了许多责任。“这是我认为每个飞行员都会努力解决的一件事，”达格说。“如果你结婚了，你把你的配偶从他们的支持结构中拉了出来，你如何为他们重建这种支持结构？我们当时不知道。在空军生活中一起工作是一件困难的事情，但沟通确实有帮助。”通过上士的职责和其他机会，他努力让别人知道他愿意伸出援助之手。从帮助飞行员完成职业发展课程培训到处理一名飞行员自杀事件，达格最想成为飞行员的朋友。然而，一旦他成为首席，一个大问题总是笼罩着他：下一步该怎么办？他回忆说，他从未打算成为一名司令。在一位同僚首领的推荐下，他一上榜就努力争取。杜格尔于2018年8月以基地指挥长的身份抵达代斯，他在日常职责之外的主要工作重点是通过基地的不同单位与飞行员联系。这有助于达格让飞行员知道他是谁，如果他们需要什么，他是可以去的人。达格说：“飞行员应该知道他们有一个随时可以接近的指挥长。”。“酋长的职位只是一个仆人，因为我为空军工作。你想去那里，因为如果有人身处黑暗地带，我很想成为他们所称的那个人。”通过与基地空军的这些关系，达格建立了一生的回忆，不仅是为他自己，也是为他周围的空军。“他不是发自内心，而是发自内心。他对员工的关怀是真诚的，”BW第七司令部首席执行助理参谋长约翰・谢弗（Johanne Schaeffer）说。“他在戴斯身上留下了良好的印象，我认为我们现在的工作是延续这一传统。”当他步入人生的下一个篇章时，达格希望能给戴斯空军留下一些智慧之言。“要知道，你在美国人民中并不常见，”达格说。“并不是每个人都举起右手加入世界上最强大的空军，也不是每个人都做出了与服役相同的牺牲，经历了与服役相同的困难。这一切归结为三件大事：了解你的职业，建立更多的关系，寻找更多的工作机会。”
168,30 years in the Air Force- Airman reflects on service,"30 years in the Air Force: Airman reflects on service
 
By Staff Sgt. Treven Cannon 
I.G. Brown Training and Education Center
 
MCGHEE TYSON AIR NATIONAL GUARD BASE, Tenn. -- Thirty years in the Air Force can bring with it a lot of sacrifice, memories, relationships, and lessons learned. What happens when it’s finally time to hang the uniform up? 
 
Master Sgt. Cynthia Wahl, a curriculum developer at the I.G. Brown Training and Education Center here, has experienced many different jobs during her time in the Air Force including dental technician, protocol, personnel,  Enlisted Professional Military Education instructor, and finally to curriculum development. 
 
It all started on Memorial Day as a third-grader, during a 4-H event walking through a cemetery. 
 
“One of our activities was to put flags on the graves. But not every single grave,” Wahl said. “I was told you must be a veteran who has served in the military to get a flag on your grave… I wanted a flag on my grave too!” 
 
This was just one of many seeds planted early in her life.  
 
“As I’ve gone through, I’ve learned of more and more ancestors who at the time I had no idea. Most of them didn't talk about their service, so it wasn’t until much later on did I find out what they did,” Wahl said, alluding to inspiring examples like learning her uncle was a Russian linguist in World War II. 
 
Wahl’s career has faced adversity with her mother-in-law being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease, and having to make a decision to move closer to home in Duluth, Minnesota, to take care of her. 
 
“I was able to confide in my boss at the time who had a similar experience with his father,” Wahl said.. “Our stories were so similar that it really helped me get through that time in our lives.” 
 
The 199X enlistee said the culture of mentorship around her was a positive aspect of being a service member, and simply asking for help, opened a lot of doors. 
 
“People are always willing to help, and guide you, and I was never hesitant to open up and just ask,” she said. “I wish more people would be willing to do that.” 
 
Wahl attributes the success she’s had with the unsung mentors she’s encountered. 
“The response has amazed me over the years that my brothers and sisters in arms would drop what they were doing to give me advice, or coach me through something I truly needed help with,” she said. “That is key to a fulfilling career.”  
 
Before she leaves the service, Wahl reflects on how to make a lasting impact.
 
“One of the things I realize is who I’ve been a mentor to, or how I’ve lifted others up, throughout my career, and that’s something you will never know,” she said. “You don’t know if just one conversation you have with someone could change the trajectory of their career or their life.” 
 
Wahl said the ability to help others stands out to her. 
 
“It was not about the rank that I achieved, but about helping the people around me rise up,” she said. “That’s what it’s about to me.”
 
Wahl’s two assignments as an instructor at TEC are an example. She trained hundreds of Airmen in leadership for NCO Academy from 2017 to 2019, including satellite classes broadcast across the nation. After some years away, she returned to teach continuing education courses, like training new instructors to carry the torch in teaching others. She keeps in touch with many of those former students. 
 
The call to service extends beyond just the uniform. Wahl said is also interested in developing her skills post-retirement as a life coach, potentially aimed at service members walking in the same boots she once did. 
 
“To be able to guide someone to their fullest potential is amazing, and I don’t think you have to be in the service, to be of service” said Wahl. 
 
When thanked for her service in public, Wahl has modified her usual response. 
 
“Even my response has changed from ‘Thank you, I appreciate it,’ to ‘It has been a lot of fun.’ Because it truly has.”",2021/6/11,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/398743/30-years-air-force-airman-reflects-service,"LOUISVILLE, TN, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国田纳西州路易斯维尔,在空军服役30年-飞行员反思服役,空军服役30年：空军服役30年：空军服役30年可以带来很多牺牲、回忆、人际关系和经验教训。当最后该挂上制服时会发生什么？辛西娅・沃尔上士是I.G.布朗训练和教育中心的课程开发人员，在空军服役期间，她经历了许多不同的工作，包括牙科技师、礼宾、人事、应征专业军事教育讲师，最后是课程开发。这一切都是从三年级学生的阵亡将士纪念日开始的，当时他在一个公墓里走了4个小时。沃尔说：“我们的活动之一是在坟墓上挂国旗，但不是每个坟墓都挂国旗。”。“有人告诉我，你必须是一名在军队服役的老兵，才能在你的坟墓上挂一面旗帜……我也希望在我的坟墓上挂一面旗帜！”这只是她早年播下的众多种子之一。沃尔说：“在我经历的过程中，我了解到越来越多的祖先，他们当时我并不知道。他们中的大多数人都没有谈论他们的服务，所以直到很久以后我才知道他们做了什么。”她提到了一些鼓舞人心的例子，比如得知她的叔叔在第二次世界大战中是一名俄罗斯语言学家。沃尔的职业生涯面临着困境，因为她的岳母被诊断患有老年痴呆症，她不得不做出决定，搬到明尼苏达州德卢斯的家附近照顾她。沃尔说：“当时我可以向我的老板吐露心声，他和他父亲有过类似的经历。”。。“我们的故事非常相似，这确实帮助我度过了生命中的那段时光。”这位199X年的应征者说，她周围的导师文化是成为一名军人的一个积极方面，仅仅寻求帮助就打开了很多大门。她说：“人们总是愿意帮助和引导你，我从不犹豫敞开心扉，只是问问而已。”。“我希望有更多的人愿意这样做。”沃尔将她在遇到的无名氏指导下取得的成功归功于她。她说：“这些年来，我的兄弟姐妹会放弃他们为给我提供建议而做的事情，或者指导我做一些我真正需要帮助的事情，我的反应让我感到惊讶。”。“这是成就事业的关键所在。”在她离职之前，沃尔思考了如何产生持久的影响。“我意识到的一件事是，在我的职业生涯中，我是谁的导师，或者我是如何提升他人的，这是你永远不会知道的，”她说。“你不知道你和某人的一次谈话是否会改变他们职业或生活的轨迹。”沃尔说，帮助他人的能力在她看来很突出。她说：“这与我所获得的地位无关，而是帮助我周围的人站起来。”。“这就是我要做的。”沃尔在TEC担任讲师的两项任务就是一个例子。从2017年到2019年，她为NCO学院培训了数百名飞行员，包括在全国广播的卫星课程。几年后，她重返继续教育课程，比如培训新的教师，让他们在教学中发挥自己的作用。她与许多以前的学生保持联系。要求服务的范围不仅限于制服。沃尔说，她也有兴趣在退休后发展自己的生活教练技能，这可能是针对那些穿着她曾经穿过的靴子走路的服务人员。沃尔说：“能够引导某人充分发挥他们的潜力是令人惊讶的，我认为你不必为他人服务，也不必为他人服务。”。当她在公众场合对自己的服务表示感谢时，沃尔改变了她通常的回答。“就连我的回答也从‘谢谢你，我很感激’变成了‘很有趣’，因为它确实很有趣。”
169,30 CES paves the way to new range capabilities,"When Vandenberg Air Force Base isn’t launching, the 30th Space Wing mission doesn’t stop, especially the mission of creating the range of the future. 

The 30th Civil Engineer Squadron Dirtboys have been hard at work creating a truck bed-down pad used to bed-down trucks and trailers outfitted with nitrogen production equipment, to support the NROL-82 launch mission from a Delta IV Heavy at Space Launch Complex 6. 

The team started construction of the new pad by SLC 6 on Aug. 5, 2020. The project was completed in 20 days, allowing the pad to be ready for the NROL-82 mission.

The multi-step process of completing the pad consisted of clearing the vegetation in the area, leveling the land, bringing in new materials, and pouring the concrete.

“The pad will be used for the bed-down of trucks and trailers outfitted with nitrogen production equipment, to supply gaseous nitrogen (GN2) for upcoming ULA Delta Heavy launches,” said Master Sgt. Ronald Weymer, 30th CES operations superintendent. “GN2 is an essential commodity for control systems and maintaining safe environments on the launch vehicle.”

The creation of the pad was critical to the mission, as the current nitrogen plant that would normally supply GN2 is undergoing upgrades, and would not be able to support the upcoming launches. To provide a solution and support the mission, the 2nd Space Launch Squadron and 30th Operations Group worked with the nitrogen provider to arrange the pad. 

The construction of the pad increases the flexibility and reliability of range infrastructure by providing a contingency location for nitrogen support when the nitrogen plant is unavailable and eliminates a single point of failure.

According to Weymer, the bed-down area is a key component of this solution. Without it, they would not be able to stage equipment to include pumper trucks, 200,000 lb liquid storage trailers and any other heavy equipment needed to ensure launch success.


“Without the team of Dirtboys, the bed-down of the Airgas equipment would not be possible and the nitrogen would not be available to make this launch happen,” said Weymer. 

Creating the range of the future is no easy task, but the 30th CES stands ready for the challenge.",2020/9/21,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/378285/30-ces-paves-way-new-range-capabilities,"VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州范登堡空军基地,30 CES为新系列功能铺平了道路,当范登堡空军基地不发射时，第30空间联队的任务并没有停止，特别是创造未来射程的任务。第30土木工程中队Dirtboys一直在努力创建一个用于固定装有氮气生产设备的卡车和拖车的卡车底座，以支持在Delta IV重型空间发射综合体6进行的NROL-82发射任务。该团队于2020年8月5日开始由SLC 6建造新的pad。该项目在20天内完成，使pad为NROL-82任务做好准备。完成pad的多步骤过程包括清理该地区的植被、平整土地、引入新材料和浇筑混凝土。CES第30届运营总监Ronald Weymer上士说：“该平台将用于配备氮气生产设备的卡车和拖车的底座，为即将到来的ULA Delta重型发射提供气态氮（GN2）。”。“GN2是控制系统和维持运载火箭安全环境的基本商品。”pad的创建对任务至关重要，因为目前通常供应GN2的氮气厂正在升级，无法支持即将到来的发射。为了提供解决方案并支持任务，第二空间发射中队和第三十作战小组与氮气供应商合作安排了pad。pad的建设增加了靶场基础设施的灵活性和可靠性，在氮气厂不可用时为氮气支持提供了应急位置，并消除了单点故障。根据Weymer的说法，下床区域是该解决方案的关键组成部分。没有它，他们将无法老化设备，包括泵车、200000磅液体储存拖车和确保发射成功所需的任何其他重型设备。“如果没有Dirtboys团队，空气气体设备将无法固定，氮气也无法使发射成功。”创造未来的范围绝非易事，但第30届消费电子展已做好迎接挑战的准备。
170,USS Champion Decommissions After 30 Years of Service,"USS Champion Decommissions After 30 Years of Service
By Lt. j.g. Russell J. Natherson, USS Champion Public Affairs

SAN DIEGO C USS Champion (MCM 4) honored nearly three decades of naval service during a decommissioning ceremony at Naval Base San Diego, Aug. 18.

Due to public health safety and restrictions of large public events related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, plankowners and former crew members of the Avenger-class ship virtually celebrated its distinguished history.

Commander, Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center, Rear Adm. Scott Robertson was the guest speaker, with Capt. Hank Kim, Commander, Mine Division TWELVE, presiding.

“With more than 90 percent of the world’s trade carried by sea, Mine Countermeasures capabilities underwrite freedom of navigation and global commerce that are essential to the world’s economy,” said Robertson. “The Avenger class ships and specifically the USS Champion, have provided robust MCM capability over the past three decades to ensure that freedom of navigation is maintained and enabled the U.S. Navy to conduct maritime operations globally. The Champion has served her crews, Navy and nation well, but now we are approaching the sundown for these MCM ships and the dawn of Littoral Combat Ship Mine Countermeasures systems. While the platforms and capabilities are changing, the one constant is that they have been and will continue to be, operated by intelligent, creative, dedicated, hardworking crews that have always ridden these unique types of ships. You, your shipmates, and your predecessors who have operated and maintained these incredibly important assets have done a tremendous job and have been instrumental to our nation’s naval arsenal of capabilities.”

Commanded by Lt. Matt Yokeley, Champion maintained a crew of eight officers and 76 enlisted Sailors.

“It has been more than an honor to command this ship and this crew over the past two years. It has been a distinct privilege C a privilege to work alongside some of the finest Sailors our Navy and our nation have to offer,” said Yokeley. “Their persistence through one adversity after the next is commendable and truly represents the spirit of the Champion motto, ‘We Accept the Challenge.’ It is now my solemn responsibility, as the ships final captain, to order the final hauling down of the colors and disembarkment of this fine ship.”

Champion was built by Marinette Marine Corporation in Marinette, Wisconsin and commissioned Feb. 8, 1991.
 
The ship’s operational history includes a five-month deployment in 1999, during which Champion assisted in the evacuation of refugees from Kosovo. Since then, Champion also participated in several mine countermeasures and bi-lateral exercises.

Champion will officially decommission Aug. 25.

171,Schriever conducts first archaeological survey in 30 years,"The 50th Civil Engineer Squadron Environmental Element organized Schriever’s first archaeological survey in more than 30 years, July 6 - 24 here.

The survey will provide the Environmental Element with information needed to sign programmatic agreements. A programmatic agreement allows the element to track construction projects on an annual basis. This means the base would consult with the state and tribes yearly instead of doing so with every project.

To conduct the survey, the Environmental Element contracted archaeologists from Metcalf Archaeology Consultants to survey more than 3,000 acres on Schriever.

“The main goal was to locate anything older than 50 years old,” said Clive Briggs, Metcalf Archaeological Consultants project director. “It’s our job then to date it and figure out what it means. We found the remains of homesteads from the early 20th century, when people were first settling in the area and the main thing they were doing was ranching. We also found projectile points (Native American arrowheads) that are prehistoric (before settlers arrived in the area).”

The survey will allow the crew to sweep the installation and determine what cultural resources are present. A cultural resource can be anything from a 10,000 year old tool to a historic homestead from 100 years ago. The projectile points found dated back to 7,800 years ago, along with stone tools, foundations of old ranches and old toys that date back to the 1930s.

All findings will be recorded and reported to tribes who have interest in the area. Findings that are considered historically significant will be protected by federal law, meaning the installation could not destroy or construct the area which is deemed significant.

“We didn’t really know what was out there,” Lawton said. “We’re legally required by the National Historic Preservation Act to protect any cultural resources we may have or that may be of interest to any tribes [who] occupied this area, [and] this [survey] will give us a much clearer image of what we’ve got here and what we need to protect.”

The primary reason this was the first survey in more than 30 years was a lack of funding.

“A lot of our previous surveys proceeded without GPS,” Lawton said. “They were done in the early 80s when the only way to locate an archaeological site was to triangulate based on land forms. That made it harder to find and protect cultural resources because we didn’t know where anything was. Now [that] the archaeological crews are working with GPS units, we can walk right out to what we need to protect and know if a proposed project will affect the sites.”

The original survey was scheduled to occur in April or May, but due to the COVID-19 outbreak the 50th CE Environmental Element had to postpone the survey.

172,Team Schriever recognizes 30 years of space superiority,"On Dec. 21, 1989, Headquarters Air Force Systems Command declared the Consolidated Space Operations Center’s Mission Control Complex-1A operational and transferred custody of its operations to Air Force Space Command. 

Upon transferring custody of MCC-1A, Air Force Space Command and the 2nd Space Wing (now the 50th SW) became fully capable to operate and maintain satellites charged to AFSPC. This included the early versions of the Global Positioning System satellites.

“It is import to remember how Schriever Air Force Base, previously Falcon Air Force Station, went from being the alternate satellite control facility for the Air Force to the primary satellite operations facility for the Air Force,” said James Mesco, 50th SW historian.

Upon the transfer of Building 400 operations, the wing controlled nine GPS satellites that only supported military users compared to its current 32 satellites that support four billion users globally.

 “Within a few years of the turnover of operations to the 2nd Space Wing, Air Force Space Command added more satellites to the wing’s control including the Defense Support Program, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program and the Defense Satellite Communications System,” Mesco said. “The wing also flew the U.S. Navy’s Fleet Satellites and the NATO communications satellite.”

Mesco said the first military satellites and ground stations began operations 60 years ago. This means the 50th has been the “Master of Space” for half of the Air Force’s space operations.

“In the early 1980’s when Air Force Space Command first came into existence, the Air Force and Department of Defense needed to expand the military space infrastructure,” he said. “At the time Sunnyvale Air Force Station (later Onizuka AFS) was limited in its ability to grow to handle the new satellite systems such as GPS, DSP, and others on the drawing board for communications and surveillance. Following three years of discussions, Colorado became the choice and the area east of Peterson Air Force Base had the land available to establish a new satellite operations complex called the Consolidate Space Operations Center.”

This land east of Peterson AFB would eventually become Schriever AFB, named after Gen. Bernard Schriever, whose grandson currently works at the base. 

“The transfer of Building 400 operations gave a permanent home to the future ‘Master of Space’ and signified the commitment of the U.S. military to the space mission,” said Lt. Col. Michael Schriever, 2nd Space Operations Squadron director of operations. “I am proud to be a part of the long line of space operators who have been a part of the 50th and continue the traditions of those before like my grandfather.”

Schriever said recognizing the wing’s heritage is important as the lessons from the past can apply to tomorrow’s victories.

“The title ‘Master of Space’ was not given but earned by the hard work of the wing’s Airmen throughout its history,” he said. “The 50th Space Wing is constantly finding ways to accomplish the mission more efficiently and with fewer resources while becoming more and more effective.”

Although the 50th SW has maintained space superiority for 30 years, the wing looks to the future and plans to continue to connect and protect to project space effects.

“U.S. military space capabilities have grown and this base along with it,” Mesco said. “As new satellite systems come on line this base will continue to be at the forefront of military space operations for generations to come.”",2019/12/17,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/356097/team-schriever-recognizes-30-years-space-superiority,"SCHRIEVER AIR FORCE BASE, CO, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国科罗拉多州施里弗空军基地,Schriever团队认识到30年的太空优势,1989年12月21日，总部空军系统司令部宣布联合空间作战中心的任务控制综合体-1A投入运行，并将其运行的监护权移交给空军空间司令部。在移交MCC-1A的保管权后，空军空间司令部和第二空间联队（现为第50西南联队）完全能够操作和维护由AFSPC负责的卫星。这包括早期版本的全球定位系统卫星。“记住施里弗空军基地，以前的猎鹰空军基地，是如何从空军的备用卫星控制设施转变为空军的主要卫星操作设施的，这很重要，”James Mesco说，第50届SW historian。在400大楼运营移交后，联队控制了9颗仅支持军事用户的GPS卫星，而其目前的32颗卫星支持全球40亿用户。梅斯科说：“在第二空间联队移交作战任务后的几年内，空军空间司令部在联队的控制下增加了更多卫星，包括国防支持计划、国防气象卫星计划和国防卫星通信系统。”。梅斯科说，第一批军用卫星和地面站60年前开始运行。这意味着第50航空母舰是空军一半空间作战的“太空主人”。他说：“在20世纪80年代初，当空军太空司令部首次成立时，空军和国防部需要扩大军事太空基础设施。”。“当时桑尼维尔空军基地（后来是Oniuka空军基地）其发展能力有限，无法处理新的卫星系统，如GPS、DSP和其他通信和监视绘图板上的卫星系统。经过三年的讨论，科罗拉多州成为选择，彼得森空军基地以东的地区有土地可用于建立一个名为彼得森空军基地以东的这片土地最终将成为施里弗空军基地，以伯纳德・施里弗将军命名，他的孙子目前在该基地工作。第二空间作战中队作战总监迈克尔・施里弗中校说：“400号楼的移交为未来的‘太空大师’提供了一个永久的家，标志着美国军方对太空任务的承诺。”。施里弗说：“我很自豪能成为50年代航天运营商中的一员，并像我祖父一样继承了以前的传统。”认识到机翼的传统非常重要，因为过去的经验教训可以应用于明天的胜利。“太空大师”的称号不是授予的，而是通过联队飞行员在其整个历史中的辛勤工作获得的，”他说。“第50个太空联队正在不断寻找方法，以更高效、更少的资源完成任务，同时变得越来越有效。”尽管第50西南航空母舰30年来一直保持着空间优势，但该航空母舰着眼未来，计划继续连接和保护以投射空间效果。“美国军事空间能力已经增强，该基地也随之发展，”梅斯科说。“随着新的卫星系统上线，这个基地将在未来几代人中继续处于军事空间行动的前沿。”
173,Demirbilek retires after 30 years of service to the Corps,"VICKSBURG, Miss. (November 15, 2019) -- In a packed conference room on a Friday morning, Dr. Zeki Demirbilek, a research hydraulics engineer for the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center’s Coastal and Hydraulics Laboratory, bid farewell to his colleagues and friends at a retirement ceremony held in his honor, November 15, 2019. 

The event began with James “Jim” Gutshall, chief of the Harbors, Entrances and Structures Branch, recognizing Demirbilek’s professional accomplishments by presenting him with a Meritorious Civilian Service Medal and was followed by a presentation of cards and a gift.

After a slide show of photos spanning Demirbilek’s 30-year career with the organization, Gutshall summed up what everyone was thinking. “It has been an honor to work with you,” he said. “We will sincerely miss you.”

Before coming to what was then known as the Waterways Experiment Station 30 years ago, Demirbilek had a diverse and extensive history, from playing professional soccer for Manchester United in England, until a career-ending injury; to graduating from the Turkish Naval Academy and serving with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; to owning his own consulting firms. As such, he not only brought a wealth of knowledge and expertise to WES/ERDC, but also a unique and distinct perspective.

However, even with all his professional accolades, many of colleagues are quick to point out that it is his role as a teacher and mentor that they will miss the most.  

Bill Seabergh, a former researcher with CHL, described how Demirbilek would give his colleagues a shiny penny for accomplishing good works or when he thought they had done a good job. “I’m not sure how this came about,” said Seabergh. “But people proudly put these on their doors with scotch tape. If you got a shiny penny, you did something good.”

Demirbilek was then presented with his own giant shiny penny. “That’s the biggest shiny penny I’ve ever seen in my life,” he said.  

“Personally, I am really appreciative of Zeki as a great mentor and teacher,” said Dr. Mike Briggs, a former researcher at CHL. Briggs went on to describe how Demirbilek volunteered to help him with his doctorate degree and even taught a course in wave dynamics at CHL.

“I’m really humbled by the kind words and appreciation in recognition of my service to ERDC and the Nation,” said Demirbilek. “I want to extend my appreciation to everyone from the bottom of my heart.”

“My career has been fantastic no question about it,” he said. “But I didn’t accomplish all of these innovative things by myself. It’s a team effort. Keep up the good work.”",2019/11/15,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/353058/demirbilek-retires-after-30-years-service-corps,"VICKSBURG, MS, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国密歇根州维克斯堡,德米尔比莱克在陆军服役30年后退休,维克斯堡，小姐。（2019年11月15日）--在一个周五上午挤满了人的会议室里，美国陆军工程师研究与发展中心海岸和水力学实验室的研究水力学工程师Zeki Demirbilek博士在2019年11月15日为他举行的退休仪式上向他的同事和朋友告别。活动由港口、入口和结构处处长James“Jim”Gutshall开始，为表彰德米比莱克的专业成就，他向德米比莱克颁发了一枚优秀的文职服务奖章，随后向他赠送了贺卡和礼物。在展示了德米比莱克在该组织30年职业生涯的照片后，古特沙尔总结了每个人的想法。“能和你们一起工作是我的荣幸，”他说。“我们会真诚地想念你。”30年前，在来到当时被称为“水道实验站”的地方之前，德米比莱克有着丰富多彩的历史，从在英格兰为曼联踢职业足球到职业生涯结束的伤病；从土耳其海军学院毕业并在北大西洋公约组织任职；拥有自己的咨询公司。因此，他不仅为WES/ERDC带来了丰富的知识和专业知识，而且还带来了独特的视角。然而，尽管他获得了所有的专业荣誉，许多同事还是很快指出，他们最怀念的是他作为教师和导师的角色。CHL的前研究员比尔・西伯格（Bill Seabergh）描述了德米尔比莱克（Demirbilek）如何给同事们一分钱，因为他们完成了好的工作，或者他认为他们做得很好。“我不知道这是怎么发生的，”西伯说。“但人们自豪地用透明胶带把这些贴在门上。如果你得到了一枚闪亮的便士，你就做了好事。”然后，德米尔比莱克收到了他自己的巨大闪亮便士。“这是我有生以来见过的最大的闪亮便士，”他说。“就我个人而言，我真的很感激Zeki是一位伟大的导师和老师，”CHL前研究员Mike Briggs博士说。Briggs接着描述了Demirbilek是如何自愿帮助他攻读博士学位的，甚至在CHL教授了一门波浪动力学课程。Demirbilek说：“我为表彰我为ERDC和国家所做的贡献而说的客气话和表示的感谢，真的让我感到谦卑。”。“我想从心底向每个人表达我的感激之情。”“毫无疑问，我的职业生涯非常精彩，”他说。“但我并不是一个人完成所有这些创新的事情。这是团队的努力。继续努力。”
174,NAVSUP Tackles Massive 30 Million Item Audit,"MECHANICSBURG, Pa. (NNS) -- Naval Supply System Command’s (NAVSUP) first-ever Enterprisewide audit is underway in support of the Defense Department’s (DoD) first agency-wide financial audit.
	
To show NAVSUP’s accountability, the fiscal year (FY) 2018 plan includes performing “book-to-floor” and “floor-to-book” inventories at sites across the command’s global enterprise.

“How do you address the challenge of providing effective oversight of over $30 billion worth of inventory spread out to over 1,000 distinct physical locations?” noted Tim Adkins, NAVSUP’s Material Control branch head. “For range and depth of our inventory, we manage about 500 thousand stock numbers, and have about 30 million physical assets on the shelf.”

The materials are not only in the United States, but also in Japan, Australia, Canada, Bahrain, and other locations.  The majority of NAVSUP inventory is held by external custodians who account by feeding inventory data to NAVSUP’s systems. This includes material stored at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), on ships, at air stations, and with numerous commercial repair vendors.

“We have responsibility to the American public,” said NAVSUP Commander Rear Adm. Jonathan A. Yuen. “We have to explain where our money is going, why we’re spending it, and in a way, say why we’re buying what we’re buying.”

NAVSUP is tackling this challenge with a system of inventories, and is also using an audit-approved inventory sampling methodology as an inventory count of all 30 million items is not feasible with the available resources. If the sampling identifies problems, complete inventories are used to ensure accountability. All classified and controlled items are inventoried 100 percent for complete accountability. 

NAVSUP Headquarters’ Inventory Control team planned 80 audits in the first six months FY2018, with 40 more locations planned in the second six months. For example, in January their team visited NAVSUP Fleet Logistics Center (FLC) Puget Sound to conduct an audit as part of their tri-annual NAVSUP Inspector General command inspection.
	
NAVSUP’s Warehouse Management Lead Tom Moslak led the audit of all the command’s sites, including a warehouse at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, working through a billion-dollar, 12-thousand line items count inventory.

They checked records and “kicked boxes,” tracking down actuator control units, radar power supplies, radar microwave tubes, hydraulic assemblies, and much more of the stuff the Navy needs.

“They’re doing great,” said Moslak. “The audit proved they are as good as they looked on paper.”

“As Supply Corps officers, we are entrusted with the safekeeping of taxpayer dollars,” said Lt. Cmdr. Chris O'Connor, NAVSUP’s Material Control Team Lead. “It is our duty and responsibility to manage these assets and ensure we have the processes, procedures, and supporting documentation in place to verify and validate what we have on the floor matches with what we have in our books.”

Audits will continue annually. “It’s not a one-time thing,” said Yuen. “It’s a team sport, and it’s a culture, and it’s a journey.  And this journey gives us the ability to find and make improvements over time.”

Headquartered in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and employing a diverse, worldwide workforce of more than 22,500 military and civilian personnel, NAVSUP's mission is to provide supplies, services, and quality-of-life support to the Navy and joint warfighter.

175,Col. Gates retires after 30 years of service,"Lying on the hood of his father’s car at the San Jose airport in California, a young Hiram ‘Paul’ Gates stared up into the sky watching airplanes fly above and he knew he wanted to fly.

Fast forward about 40 years, Col. Hiram ‘Paul’ Gates III retired from the Air Force after 30 years of service July 1, 2018.

Holding the position of vice commander of the 434th ARW since 2015, Gates supported and directed the largest KC-135R Stratotanker unit in the Air Force Reserve Command.

“Friends, squadron mates, families members C this is truly humbling,” Gates said. “I am so blessed and privileged to have worked for the people of this wing.”

Gates’ Air Force career began in 1988 when he received a commission after graduating from the Air Force Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree in international relations.

He then entered pilot training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona, and was assigned to the 905th Air Refueling Squadron, Grand Forks Air Force Base, North Dakota.

In 1997, he transferred to the Air Force Reserve where he flew the KC-135R Stratotanker with the 63rd Air Refueling Squadron at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, Michigan.

Gates has held numerous positions and assignments including USAF Academy admissions liaison officer, and numerous flight and squadron commander positions serving at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, and Andersen Air Force Base, Guam.

Fast forward to 2011, Gates joined the 72nd Air Refueling Squadron at Grissom as a KC-135R Stratotanker instructor pilot. In 2012 he joined the 434th Operations Group as the deputy commander.

“If you asked Paul what his favorite job was, he’d say it was being a squadron commander,” said Col. Larry Shaw, 434th ARW commander. “But if you ask him what was the best opportunity C it’s being the vice wing commander.”

Gates’ impression on the wing and Airmen was evident by the hundreds of attendees present for his retirement ceremony, including members from the 63rd Air Refueling Squadron, a Blackhawk pilot, former Army Ranger, and former wing leaders, among others.

“I consider myself most fortunate being able to share a few moments of my time with Colonel Gates and [wife] Anne,” said (Ret.) Doug Schwartz, former 434th ARW commander, relaying a message from Chief Master Sgt. Robert Herman, Headquarters Air Force, senior enlisted manager and former 434th ARW command chief. “Colonel Gates is confident, competent, honest, passionate and has a great sense of humor. He’s committed to service, his Airmen and our families. He’s committed to our nation I know Cbecause I’ve seen it.”

“Colonel Gates’ retirement is tough for me,” Shaw said. “He’s an aviator’s aviator. He’s been a friend, confidant and advisor for a long time and I’ve really enjoyed both not only working with him, but learning from him over the years.”

Honest, genuine and humble are words frequently used to describe Gates.

“It has truly been a privilege to serve my constitution and country,” Gates addressed the crowd. “Throughout my career, I could not pick anytime, anywhere, that I knew what was I was going to be three years down the road. But if you [Airmen] get an opportunity that in your career C whether it’s being a first sergeant, PME, or an opportunity for growth C take it. Be that person to step up; don’t do it for yourself C do it for your Airmen.”

“In the 1960s when President Kennedy gave a directive that the United States was going to put a man on the moon, if you walked into NASA and talked to an engineer or the man sweeping the floor, they’d tell you the same thing: ‘we’re putting a on the moon,” he continued.
“That’s this wing when it comes to the mission. Here in north central Indiana all of you have a direct effect on our ability to defend our national security.”

The 434th ARW is the largest KC-135R Stratotanker unit in the Air Force Reserve Command. The Citizen Airmen from the Hoosier Wing routinely deploy around the world in support of the Air Force mission.

All aviation and military enthusiasts from across the Last Frontier are invited to the free event for some high-flying action at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. 

In previous years, more than 250,000 people have attended the open house and experienced a seemingly neverending series of static displays C both military and civilian C across a 30-acre field. 

“Our theme this year is ‘Shared Heritage,’” said Air Force Maj. Jeri-Lynn Harper, Arctic Thunder Open house director. “We chose the theme because it encompasses the joint aspect of JBER C not just military, but also the local community. We are afforded a lot of opportunities in Alaska, and we get a lot of support from the local community. The open house is our way of saying thank you.” 

Hangars full of family fun await, with face-painting, bouncy houses and an obstacle course. 

Hear the sounds of freedom as demonstration teams for the F-22 Raptor, U.S. Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier, F-16 Viper and C-17 Globemaster III perform impressive displays of aerial acrobatics. But the nonstop action won’t end there C the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds are this year’s headliners and are sure to put on an impressive performance. 

The show is not just in the air. Experience the awesome skills of the joint forces demonstration team as paratroopers perform a mock assault on the demonstration field. 

New this year will be the addition of Science Technology Engineering and Math demonstrations, said Dana Rosso, JBER Public Affairs chief of community engagement.

177,Col. Ryan to retire after 30 years of service,"Under cover of Hangar 254, here, mid-afternoon light streaming through the windows, with a KC-135 Stratotanker staged behind him, Col. James ""Jim"" P. Ryan celebrated his more than 30-year career with family, friends and generations of Wingmen in front of him on April 7, 2018. 

Ryan will retire from the 157th Air Refueling Wing in May, after three decades of service to the U.S. Air Force, including over 20 with the New Hampshire Air National Guard. 

As the child of a military retiree, the youngest of nine, the Virginia native grew up with close ties to the military installations around him, including Fort McNair and Andrews Air Force Base. 

""If you have ever been to a base theater, you know they always play the national anthem at the beginning, before the movie-no matter the branch of service,"" Ryan said. ""It was years before I attended a civilian theater and realized it was only a military thing. In any case, this stemmed a deep sense of patriotism and desire to serve whereas I constantly saw good people in uniform and was inspired by their courage, professionalism and what they believed.""

His father, Howard Ryan, served in the U.S. Army Air Corps, and then the U.S. Air Force, when it became a separate branch in 1947. The veteran of World War II and Korea opened Jim's eyes to what would be a lifelong passion.

""Although retired prior to my birth, his love of aviation was, no doubt, my primary motivation for becoming an Air Force pilot,"" said Ryan. ""I had fallen in love with flying at age five, when I flew on an airplane for the first time, a Boeing 707.""

Ryan described the Air Force open houses and air shows he would attend with his father, particularly the annual pilgrimage of sorts they made to Oshkosh, Wisconsin, for the Experimental Aircraft Association's Air Venture. The weeklong airshow included demonstrations from the U.S. and international teams, like the Thunderbirds.

""There, he and I would wander through the fields of vintage war-birds and watch them fly each afternoon,"" said Ryan. ""I would lay in the grass, gazing in wonder of what it would be like to fly them.""

On April 23, 1988, Ryan took one step closer to realizing that dream. He graduated from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with a degree in aeronautical engineering, earning his commission as a second lieutenant through the university’s Air Force ROTC program. 

During the commissioning ceremony, Ryan's father and stepmother pinned on his rank. His then girlfriend, now wife, Mary Ellen took photos of the occasion.

""The normal and fun excitement and craziness of a family gathering is a consistent memory, but what I really remember most was that the people who loved and who had supported me were there,"" Ryan said.

He was then selected to attend Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas.

""My expectations were that it would be an intense year of training,"" said Ryan. ""It was. Wonderful, challenging, intense and remarkably fun. No surprises.""

Afterward, Ryan attended the Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals course as a student pilot, training on the Northrop AT-38B Talon, at Holloman AFB, New Mexico, after which he was assigned to the F-111D Readiness Training Unit at Cannon AFB, New Mexico, as an Aircraft Commander Trainee, working with the General Dynamics F-111D Aardvark.

Earning his pilot wings in 1989, he served at Royal Air Force Lakenheath, England. He filled many roles, including an F-111F Aircraft Commander.

He then deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Provide Comfort, to preserve the ""No-Fly"" zone of Northern Iraq. 

In 1992, he served at Sheppard AFB as a Joint Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (JSUPT) T-37 instructor pilot, training U.S. and NATO AF students. 

Ryan joined the NH Air National Guard in 1996, and was assigned to the 133rd Air Refueling Squadron, where he filled numerous roles including aeromedical evacuation coordination officer, assistant flight commander, and flight commander. He assumed command of the 133rd ARS in 2011.

After commanding the 157th Operations Group and serving as an assistant to the adjutant general and functional lead for KC-46A conversion, Ryan took command of the 157th ARW, his final role within the U.S. Air Force.

""Let's just say, it was not expected,"" said Ryan. ""Given the opportunity-I said, 'Absolutely, yes!' and my wife was very supportive, which made the difference for me.""

As the Wing Commander, Ryan was responsible for supervising the Wing's air refueling, airlift and aero-medical evacuation missions, which support U.S. and coalition contingency operations, as well as the U.S. Strategic Command's strategic deterrence mission.

""28 years of watching, listening, learning, taking risks and trying new things certainly helped shape who I am, what I believe,"" Ryan said. ""Every day is an opportunity to prepare for what may come next. I had a lot of great instructors and mentors along the way, and tried to use all the positive tidbits I could.""

Between deployments, base construction, KC-46 conversion preparations, senior leadership transitions and many other considerations, Ryan credits the professionals around him for being able to tackle all the challenges.

""It has been an uplifting sensation that has kept me focused, positive and even healthy during my time in command,"" said Ryan. “There are plenty of long days and unforeseen challenges, but I was pleasantly surprised to have a fresh energy and resolve each day to tackle them. I think I can credit it to having an incredible team of professionals on the staff that made it easy to start each day anew.""

On February 23, 2018, Ryan made his fini-flight from Pease Air National Guard Base as call sign Lipper. The fini-flight, or last flight, is an aviator's tradition dating back to World War II.

Wingmen and family members awaited his return to the flight line. Upon his arrival, his three children sprayed him with streams of champagne, keeping with tradition. Soaking wet, with the winter wind whipping him in the face, Ryan hugged and shook hands with nearly every person there.

""I couldn't have done it without them, their love and support,"" Ryan said, expressing gratitude for his family. ""They have been my personal champions of support and their encouragement has made a difference throughout my career.""

After hanging up his Air Force uniform, he will return to another. Ryan will begin training to pilot Boeing 757 and 767s for United Airlines this spring.

""I am blessed to have been able to serve and fly both on active duty and in the Guard,"" Ryan said. ""Although bittersweet to be hanging up my military uniform, I look forward to the way ahead, flying both international and domestic. I hope to see many of you again in the friendly skies.""",2018/4/7,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/273039/col-ryan-retire-after-30-years-service,"NEWINGTON, NH, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国新罕布什尔州纽因顿,Ryan上校将在服役30年后退休,2018年4月7日，在254号机库的掩护下，午后阳光透过窗户，一架KC-135平流层加油机在他身后上演，詹姆斯“吉姆”P・瑞安上校与家人、朋友和几代僚机一起庆祝了他30多年的职业生涯。Ryan在美国空军服役30年，包括在新罕布什尔州空军国民警卫队服役20多年后，将于5月从第157空中加油联队退役。作为一名退役军人的孩子，他是9个孩子中最小的一个，这位弗吉尼亚本地人与周围的军事设施有着密切的联系，包括麦克奈尔堡和安德鲁斯空军基地。Ryan说：“如果你去过基地剧院，你就会知道他们总是在开始时演奏国歌，在电影开始之前，不管是哪个部门。”。“几年后，我才参加了一个平民剧院，并意识到这只是一个军事事件。无论如何，这源于一种强烈的爱国主义和服务欲望，而我经常看到穿着制服的好人，他们的勇气、专业精神和他们的信仰激励着我。”他的父亲霍华德・瑞安曾在美国陆军航空队服役，然后是美国空军，1947年成为一个独立的分支。这位二战和朝鲜战争的老兵让吉姆看到了他毕生的激情。“虽然在我出生之前就退休了，但他对航空的热爱无疑是我成为空军飞行员的主要动机，”瑞安说。“我五岁时就爱上了飞行，那是我第一次乘坐波音707飞机。”Ryan描述了他将与父亲一起参加的空军开放日和航空展，特别是他们每年为实验飞机协会的航空企业前往威斯康星州的奥什科什朝圣。为期一周的航展包括来自美国和国际团队的演示，如雷鸟。“在那里，他和我每天下午都会在老式战鸟的田野里漫步，看着它们飞翔，”Ryan说。1988年4月23日，瑞安离实现这个梦想又近了一步。他毕业于Embry Riddle航空大学，获得了航空工程学位，通过该大学的空军后备军官训练计划获得了少尉的职位。在委任仪式上，Ryan的父亲和继母对他的职位进行了监督。他当时的女朋友、现在的妻子玛丽・艾伦（Mary Ellen）拍摄了这一场景。“家庭聚会的正常、有趣、兴奋和疯狂是一种始终如一的记忆，但我真正记得最多的是，爱我和支持我的人都在那里。”随后，他被选中参加在德克萨斯州谢泼德空军基地举行的欧洲-北约联合喷气式飞机飞行员训练。“我的期望是，这将是一个紧张的训练年，”Ryan说。“这是一场精彩、充满挑战、激烈且非常有趣的比赛。毫无意外。”之后，Ryan作为一名学生飞行员参加了在新墨西哥州霍洛曼空军基地进行的诺斯罗普AT-38B塔龙战斗机基础介绍课程的训练，之后他被分配到新墨西哥州坎农空军基地的F-111D战备训练部队，作为一名受训飞机指挥官，他在通用动力公司F-111D Aardvark工作。1989年获得了飞行员翅膀，他在英国皇家空军Lakenheath服役。他担任了许多职务，包括一名F-111F飞机指挥官。随后他被部署到伊拉克支持“提供舒适”行动，以保护伊拉克北部的“禁飞区”。1992年，他在Sheppard空军基地担任联合专业本科生飞行员培训（JSUPT）T-37教练飞行员，培训美国和北约空军学生。Ryan于1996年加入NH空军国民警卫队，并被分配到第133空中加油中队，在那里他担任了许多职务，包括航空医疗后送协调官、助理飞行指挥官和飞行指挥官。2011年，他开始指挥第133次ARS。在指挥第157次作战小组并担任KC-46A改装副司令和职能负责人的助理后，Ryan指挥了第157次ARW，这是他在美国空军中的最后一个角色。Ryan说：“我们只是说，这不是预期的。”。“有了这个机会，我说，‘绝对，是的！’我妻子非常支持，这让我与众不同。”作为联队指挥官，Ryan负责监督联队的空中加油、空运和航空医疗后送任务，这些任务支持美国和联军的应急行动，以及美国战略司令部的战略威慑任务。“28年的观察、倾听、学习、冒险和尝试新事物无疑有助于塑造我是谁，我相信什么，”Ryan说。“每一天都是一个为未来做准备的机会。在这一过程中，我有很多优秀的导师和导师，并试图利用我所能利用的所有积极的小道消息。”在部署、基地建设、KC-46转换准备、高级领导层过渡和许多其他考虑因素之间，Ryan称赞他周围的专业人士能够应对所有挑战。“这是一种令人振奋的感觉，让我在指挥期间保持专注、积极甚至健康，”Ryan说。“有很多漫长的日子和不可预见的挑战，但我惊喜地发现，我每天都有新的精力和决心来应对这些挑战。我认为，我可以归功于员工中拥有一支令人难以置信的专业团队，让我可以轻松地重新开始每一天。"2018年2月23日，Ryan作为呼号Lipper从Pease空军国民警卫队基地进行了fini飞行。fini飞行，或最后一次飞行，是飞行员的传统，可以追溯到第二次世界大战。僚机和家人等待着他返回飞行线。在他到达后，他的三个孩子向他喷洒了香槟，与tra保持一致雷恩浑身湿透，寒风打在脸上，他拥抱了几乎所有在场的人，并与他们握手。“没有他们，没有他们的爱和支持，我不可能做到这一点，”雷恩说，并对他的家人表示感谢。“他们是我个人支持的拥护者，他们的鼓励在我的职业生涯中起到了重要作用。”挂上空军制服后，他将重返另一家。瑞安将于今年春天开始为联合航空公司（United Airlines）驾驶波音757和767飞机进行培训瑞安说：“我很幸运能够在现役和警卫部队服役和飞行。虽然挂军服让我苦乐参半，但我期待着前方的道路，无论是国际还是国内的飞行。我希望在友好的天空中再次见到你们中的许多人。”

179,Local family ‘adopts’ service members for 30 years,"As Janice Deaver and her daughter April Griffin prepare Thanksgiving dinner for their family and neighbors, they tell stories and share laughs at memories of years past. While most share stories about their relatives, this family shares stories of their “adopted” family, the ones they thank each year for their service to their country with a home-cooked meal.

For the past 30 years, the Deaver family has opened their home on Thanksgiving Day to “adopted” U.S. service members from the Hampton Roads community as part of the annual “Adopt-a-Service Person” program.

The program, hosted by the USO, has approximately 60 families in the local community each year “adopt” service members who are in training and are unable to go home for the holiday.

The Deaver family first heard of the program from an advertisement in the local newspaper. Griffin remembers being 16 years old when they brought home their first “adopted” service members and now had a 16-year-old daughter and a 13-year-old son of her own as her family continues the tradition. Even though the family has no affiliation with the military, they couldn’t see sharing the holiday without hosting service members and passalong the tradition of being thankful.

 “My parents always had a full house, and it just seemed like such a good idea to show April that you give back,” said Deaver. “It makes my heart so happy to bring in these kids because they are so brave and so kind and it’s great to show my daughter and my grandkids that every year.”

Continuing the tradition of storytelling, Griffin and Deaver shared bouts of laughter as they remembered one year when a U.S. Army Soldier in Advanced Individual Training who participated in the program broke his glasses while playing football with Griffin’s children in the yard. 

“We looked for the arm of his glasses for hours but had no luck,” said Griffin. “Mom found the arm in the spring. I brought it to his graduation from AIT, and he just thought it was the funniest thing.”

With as many as nine service members welcomed into their home each year, Deaver struggles with the idea that some of their first Soldiers have recently retired from the Army within the 30 years since they first joined the program. However, Griffin enjoys keeping in touch with the service members through social media. 

“It’s hard to believe we’ve been doing this as long as we have, but it’s just become normal for us,” said Deaver. “They are always welcome to come back to our family dinner if they are in the local area.”

For the service members they adopt, the program allowed them to be a part of a family―a home away from home for the holiday, said U.S. Army Private 1st Class Jalani James, 128th Aviation Brigade AIT student.

“Nowadays, many people will say, ‘Thank you for your service’ and ‘We are proud of what you do’ but I don’t think they extend their hand out as much as they extend their words,” said James. “This family didn’t use their words, they let their actions speak for them, and they invited us in. After speaking with them, I know they’re deeply rooted in their community, and they care, not just for the service members, but for the people that live near them.”

As six Soldiers, one U.S. Air Force Airman, twelve family members and neighbors squeeze around the table, they pass plates of turkey, ham, and stuffing, and continue to share stories and laughs until it is time to clean up and say goodbye to their new family members for now.

180,"30 years of service- mistakes made, lessons learned","MCCONNELL AIR FORCE BASE, Kan. C- A picture of him as a master sergeant hangs on the wall in his office, welcoming every Airman who walks through the door. To some it may seem as a decoration of self-importance, but if you ask him, he’ll tell you it holds a much different significance.

“I have the picture there to remind me that I can’t think like a command chief,” said Chief Master Sgt. Shawn Hughes, 22nd Air Refueling Wing command chief. “If I have an expectation that an airman, a staff sergeant or a master sergeant see the world the same way that I do, then that’s a poor assumption, and I’m thinking wrong. Because if you forget who you are, you forget where you came from, you forget the challenges you had or you forget the path that you’ve taken, chances are you will never see any other options or roads to take.”

Hughes joined the Air Force in 1987 with an open-general contract and received the job of in-flight refueling specialist for Strategic Air Command. 

“I joined the Air Force because I was not going in a good direction,” said Hughes. “I failed out of college and was working dead-end jobs. Some of the people I was hanging out with were not good people. Some of the things I was doing weren’t very good either.”

Throughout his career, he deployed numerous times as a boom operator, many of which he volunteered for. Around his 10-year point in the Air Force, he had more days on temporary duty assignment than he had at home station.

“I still hadn’t grown up even though I joined the Air Force,” said Hughes. “I was living the same lifestyle that I was living before I joined the military. Some of it was the aircrew lifestyle back then―you could stay out until three in the morning, raising hell, doing whatever you wanted, and as long as you flew your missions, nobody messed with you.”

He had been in the Air Force for about 12 years and had been a staff sergeant for six years when he came to a crossroads. 

“I got to a point in life where everything was coming un-glued,” said Hughes. “I had a couple of significantly emotional events [occurring] and I was trying to figure out why, because I didn’t understand. For a long time, I just thought I was a victim of life. I didn’t realize that it was me.” 

During this rough period, Hughes came to a realization that changed the course of his military career. 

“It was like stepping out of a fog,” explained the chief. “At that point, I realized that the things happening in my life were because of my actions, because of what I was doing, because of how I was living my life up to that point. The only way to have a different life than the one that I had was to change. Rather than do the minimum necessary, I actually had to work hard, learn things that I never wanted to learn and change the way I see the world. 

“The first step is recognizing that the path you’re on is a bad path,” he emphasized. “Start pointing a finger at yourself. You’re the one who has problems with everybody, you’re the one who thinks that nobody understands you, but maybe you’re the one who doesn’t understand yourself. Once you’re aware of it, have that desire and drive to be a little bit better each day and to get it right the next time.”

After this epiphany, Hughes then achieved the rank of technical sergeant his next try, the rank of master sergeant his first try, senior master sergeant his second time and chief master sergeant his first time testing. He continued to have many achievements throughout his career, to include winning Air Education and Training Command Instructor Boom Operator of the Year 2001, the General Dutch Huyer award―a specialized aircrew mission award for exemplary service, distinguished graduate Senior NCO Academy recognition and many more awards. 

“If I strip everything away, I love my job,” said Hughes. “I loved being in a deployed environment and taking all of the training and all of the preparation and then going somewhere and actually executing what you were trained to do. [The boom pod] was a great place to think and a great place to be as an introvert―it was very comforting environment for me. I’m a hard-core introvert, so climbing on an airplane with only a tight-knit group and not having to talk to anybody if you don’t want to is nice.”

As Hughes made higher rank throughout his service, he found himself moving away from the job he loved and into a more unfamiliar role. He held many special duty positions, including academy military trainer at the Air Force Academy and serving as a flight instructor at the AETC school house at Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma, training a new generation of boom operators, which required him to grasp a direct leadership role and step out of his comfort zone. 
 
“The transition from being a technical expert into being responsible for people wasn’t natural for me,” he explained. “When I went to the school house and actually had to start teaching people, it really forced me to be a receptive leader. I had to understand who [the students] were, what their motivating factors were, why they were there and then try to tap into that.”

Though Hughes will be retiring from service this year, he continually aims to mentor Airmen and pass on philosophies. 

“Chief Hughes is very engaging and always there to help people,” said Col. Albert Miller, 22nd ARW commander. “He has an ability to connect one-on-one with Airmen. He gets to know the Airmen, their story and what he can do for them on a personal level. He’s extremely dedicated overall. He’s not taking terminal leave. His last day of his 30th year will be in uniform; he wanted to work until the very end.”

Many of Hughes’ previous supervisors and fellow Airmen have influenced his leadership style throughout his career and shaped his definition of what it is it means to be a leader. It is a methodology he imparts when mentoring Airmen. 

“A leader is someone who is standing somewhere on a ladder, sees someone below, grabs them by the hand, pulls them up on their level and has a conversation with them,” said Hughes. “A great leader is someone whose interaction leads that person to success in some way, shape or form. And if you’re an even better leader, you put your hand underneath them, and you push them to surpass your level and be better than you ever could be.”

Hughes has been in a leadership position for about 19 years, and although being a mentor to Airmen is a role he thoroughly enjoys, he emphasizes that it comes at a price. 

“I stayed 30 years because I love it. I used to love it because of the job, and now I love it because of the people,” said Hughes. “But there’s a burden that comes with leadership. What if you’re messing that up? What if what you’re doing isn’t making a positive difference? What if how you’re approaching things and solving problems is creating issues rather than solving them? Over a period of time those questions wear on you.” 


After many years of mentoring Airmen and shaping the type of leader that he wants to be, Hughes is now walking toward the door to retirement. 

“I know it’s the time to leave, and I get that, but I also think that I have something left in the gas tank,” said Hughes. “At this point, I have more to give. I’m becoming the type of person I wish I was 20 years ago. I have a whole different idea of what life is and I’m at a point where I’m finally starting to understand the puzzle coming together, and now it’s time to leave.”

After three decades of honorable military service, Hughes is now looking at what the future may hold for him.

“A little horse farm and about 10 acres―that’s what’s next,” said Hughes. That’s where I need to be. That’s where my family needs to be. I need to disconnect for a while. Owning a horse farm is basic hard work. I think that for a period of time I don’t want to be morally responsible for anybody else.

181,"Picture worth 1,000 words- 30 years of heritage","Glancing over a 1985 family portrait, a man is awestruck at the image of his younger self. The snapshot of his mother cradling him as his siblings welcomed back their father from a deployment captured a moment that was stronger than words.
Although he was too young to remember the moment, Maj. Jonathan Elliott, 23d Logistics Readiness Squadron director of operations, began his own search to retrieve this piece of heritage, which became the event that forged a stronger bond between father and son, who both served as Team Moody Airmen and Air Force officers.
“We were completely unaware of the photo’s existence,” said retired Lt. Col. Gary Elliott, a then 347th Tactical Fighter Wing F-4E Phantom II pilot from 1983-1986. “When the picture was taken, my whole attention was on my family, and I didn’t know we were the subject of an impromptu photo. I didn’t know if the photo had ever been used in an article or the base newspaper, but it was slice of life in our family history, and we wanted to obtain it.”
According to Gary, the wife of a former squadron mate, who lived in Valdosta, sent the family a snapshot of their big framed photograph that hung on the wall at the Moody Officers’ Club.
Determined to find it, the Elliott’s asked the Moody Field Club and base photo lab for a chance to reprint the photo, but unfortunately, the host wing changed, resulting in the removal of the frame from the heritage wall, derailing their plans. 
However, in the summer of 2015, fate would have it that another Elliott would spearhead the continued search. 
“When I moved here, one of the first places I went was the [Moody Field Club],” said Jonathan. “I was excited to finally get to see the actual picture and I wanted to get copies of it for my family.  But it wasn’t there, disappointingly. So, I started asking around to try to locate it.  I talked with the [Moody Field Club] management, the wing historian, and any civilian I crossed paths with who’d been working on base long enough to have seen it.”
Although everyone he asked was incredibly gracious and tried to help, Jonathan kept coming up empty while he rummaged through various storage closets and boxes of old pictures. One day in May 2016, however, that all changed. As Col. Susan Riordan-Smith, 23d Mission Support Group commander, gave a briefing in the First Term Airmen Center building, she saw the picture that Jonathan was searching for all along and immediately notified him.
“I was shocked and relieved because it seemed too good to be true,” said Jonathan. “I went over to the FTAC building immediately so I could see it for myself. It was a bit surreal as well because it’s my parents, siblings and me.
“It naturally created an emotional connection with me, and yet, the photographer perfectly captured the joy of military member and family reunited in such a way that it makes an emotional connection, even if you don’t know the people in the picture,” Elliott added. “It just has that iconic look.”
While he was tempted to immediately tell his dad of the finding, he wanted to savor the moment for a special day. As all parties in the photo were present in Washington state in June, on Father’s Day, Jonathan uttered the words “I have something for you, Dad.” 
As Jonathan brought out a large, thin package in brown paper wrap, Gary handled what he says   felt a framed object and wondered if it might possibly be “the photo.”  
“As I unwrapped it and saw that it was, I was a little choked up,” said Gary. “I think the whole family was a bit emotional. They had all seen the little snapshot on a shelf in our dining room, and knew that we had searched in vain for the actual photo. Everyone was happy that Jon had been able to track it down and get one for the family. He had it beautifully matted and framed, and it was a very special Fathers’ Day gift!” 
For Gary, no gift could compare to the strong bond that he and Jonathan have forged over the years. 
“Sharing the United States Air Force Academy as our alma mater strengthened this bond, and when I visit him at his duty stations, he always takes me in to his unit and helps me understand the mission and his responsibilities.”
Gary is also appreciative of Jonathan wearing his old squadron’s paraphernalia and highlighting his heritage which is among the many things he says brings him pride. 
“Two of my most proud moments of Jonathan was presenting his USAFA appointment [certificate] and administering the oath upon his promotion to major,” said Gary. “I put my uniform on for both of those occasions, and although it’s not the current style, it’s still “Air Force blue” and is a bond to Jon in his blues.  I’m proud to wear it, and I think Jon is proud to see me wear it.”
“Beyond the Air Force bond, it is still hard for me to stand for the national anthem and look at our flag without being a little choked up, and I trust Jon will always share this mixture of pride, humility, and gratefulness with me,” Gary added. “A bond unfortunately not shared by many of our countrymen these days.”",2017/8/18,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/245315/picture-worth-1000-words-30-years-heritage,"MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佐治亚州穆迪空军基地,图片价值1000字-30年传承,一个男人瞥了一眼1985年的家庭肖像，他对自己年轻时的形象感到敬畏。当他的兄弟姐妹们迎接他们的父亲从一次部署中归来时，他的母亲抱着他，这张快照捕捉到了一个比语言更强烈的时刻。尽管他还太小，记不起那一刻，23 D后勤准备中队作战总监Jonathan Elliott少校开始了他自己的搜寻，以找回这片遗产，这一事件在父亲和儿子之间建立了更牢固的纽带，他们都是穆迪空军队员和空军军官。“我们完全不知道这张照片的存在，”退休中校加里・埃利奥特（Gary Elliott）说，他当时是1983-1986年间第347战术战斗机联队F-4E幻影II飞行员。“拍摄这张照片时，我的全部注意力都集中在我的家人身上，我不知道我们是一张即兴照片的拍摄对象。我不知道这张照片是否曾被刊登在一篇文章或基础报纸上，但它是我们家族历史中的一部分，我们想得到它。”前中队队友的妻子加里说，住在瓦尔多斯塔的埃利奥特一家给这家人寄去了一张挂在穆迪军官俱乐部墙上的大框照片的快照。埃利奥特一家决心找到它，向穆迪菲尔德俱乐部和基地照片实验室请求重印照片的机会，但不幸的是，东道主换了一张照片，导致从遗产墙上拆除框架，使他们的计划脱轨。然而，在2015年夏天，命运注定另一位艾略特将带头继续搜寻。乔纳森说：“当我搬到这里时，我最先去的地方之一就是（穆迪球场俱乐部）。”。“我很高兴终于看到了真实的照片，我想给我的家人复印一份。但令人失望的是，照片不在那里。因此，我开始四处打听，试图找到它。我与[穆迪菲尔德俱乐部]进行了交谈。”管理层、机翼历史学家，以及我遇到的任何一位在基地工作了足够长时间的平民都看到了它。”尽管他要求的每个人都非常亲切，并试图帮助他，但乔纳森一直空着出来，同时他翻遍了各种储藏柜和旧照片盒。然而，在2016年5月的某一天，一切都发生了变化。当23 D任务支援小组指挥官苏珊・里奥丹・史密斯上校在第一任期空军中心大楼作简报时，她看到乔纳森一直在寻找的照片，立即通知了他。“我感到震惊和欣慰，因为这似乎太好了，不可能是真的，”乔纳森说。“我立刻去了FTAC大楼，这样我就可以亲眼看到它。它也有点超现实，因为它是我的父母、兄弟姐妹和我。埃利奥特补充说：“这自然会让我产生一种情感上的联系，然而，摄影师完美地捕捉到了军人和家人团聚的喜悦，即使你不认识照片中的人，也会产生一种情感上的联系。它只是具有那种标志性的外观。”当他想马上告诉父亲这一发现时，他想在这特殊的一天好好享受这一时刻。照片中的所有人都在6月的华盛顿州父亲节那天到场，乔纳森说：“爸爸，我有东西要给你。”当乔纳森拿出一个棕色纸包装的又大又薄的包裹时，加里处理着他所说的东西，他感觉到一个有框的物体，想知道它是否可能是“照片”。“当我打开包装，看到它是，我有点哽咽，”加里说。“我想全家人都有点情绪化。他们都看到了我们餐厅架子上的小快照，知道我们找不到真实的照片。每个人都很高兴乔恩能够找到它，并为家人买了一张。他把它漂亮地叠好，装裱好，这是一个非常特别的父亲节。”对加里来说，没有什么礼物能与他和乔纳森多年来建立的牢固关系相比。“我们的母校是美国空军学院，这加强了这种关系，当我在他的工作地点拜访他时，他总是把我带到他的部队，帮助我了解任务和他的责任。”加里也很欣赏乔纳森穿着他的旧中队装备，突出他的传统，这是他说给他带来自豪的许多事情之一。“乔纳森最让我自豪的两个时刻是出示他的USAFA任命[证书]，并在他晋升到少校时主持宣誓仪式，”加里说。“我在这两个场合都穿上了制服，虽然它不是现在的款式，但它仍然是“空军蓝”，是乔恩蓝调的纽带。我很自豪穿上它，我想乔恩也很自豪看到我穿上它。”加里补充说：“除了空军的关系，我仍然很难站在国歌前，看着国旗而不感到有点哽咽。我相信乔恩会永远和我分享这种自豪、谦逊和感激的混合体。不幸的是，现在很多国人都没有这种关系。”

183,"REAL ID Act, effective changes Jan. 30","In late November, Montana was denied an extension to the REAL ID Act implementation which means beginning Jan. 30, 2017, individuals seeking entry to Malmstrom will need to provide a form of compliant identification to be granted access to the base.

According to the Department of Homeland Security’s website, the REAL ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 by the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation that the federal government set standards for the issuance of sources of identification.

The act established minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and ID cards and prohibits federal agencies from accepting for official purposes licenses and ID cards that do not meet these standards.

Since the act was established, Montana has opted to not comply and the federal government has granted extensions to their non-compliance. The extensions allowed Montana ID cards to be accepted as proof of identification and allowed individuals access to the installation.

However, beginning Jan. 30, all individuals will need to have a form of compliant identification such as an approved state ID or passport.

“We have been working hand-in-hand with (agencies across the base) to work with the contractors who come to work on Malmstrom to minimize impacts to base services, local partnerships and businesses,” said Maj. Marc Ortiz, 341st Security Forces Squadron commander.

In the past, security forces Airmen have issued Defense Biometric Identification System cards which granted contractors unescorted access to the base. DBIDS cards issued with a non-compliant ID before the implementation of the REAL ID Act will be accepted until their expiration. After Jan. 30, DBIDS cards will only be issued to compliant ID card holders.

“Day-to-day pieces will be different for individuals looking to sponsor guests onto the base as well,” Ortiz said.

Currently, Airmen are able to sponsor guests onto base, granting them unescorted access to the installation. After the implementation in January, individuals looking for sponsorship will need to possess a compliant form of identification.

Sponsoring and escorting are two different scenarios and Airmen will need to understand which they are requesting.

“If you wish to escort them, which means you are escorting your visitor’s physical presence, they do not have to have a REAL ID Act compliant identification card,” Ortiz said.

However, for security purposes, guests being escorted onto the installation will need a compliant form of identification between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5:59 a.m.

These changes also apply to visitors wanting to visit the base museum.

185,1-30 Inf. prepares armored companies for IRC,"By Pfc. Payton Wilson
1-30th Inf., 2-3IBCT UPAR 

FORT STEWART, Ga. - Leaders of 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division conducted Battle Focus at Fort Stewart, Georgia, March 6-15.

Battle Focus is a battalion-level training exercise to prepare Companies A and B, 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd ID, for validation at Joint Readiness Training Center, Fort Polk, Louisiana as the  immediate ready company supporting the global response force.

“At the end of the day you have one force that is able to train, as well as fight, in whatever capacity and whatever type of environment,” said Command Sgt. Maj. Quentin Fenderson, senior enlisted advisor of 1-30th Inf.

The armor companies were attached to 1-30th Inf. Feb. 16, 2016, to train for IRC.

“Initially trying to get all those different things put into place, we had to build those relationships to make this work,” Fenderson said. “It’s not often that a light battalion gets the opportunity to train a mechanized battalion, but it’s been some great lessons learned, as well as understanding the firepower that’s available with the Bradley fighting vehicles.”

By assuming the IRC role, the armored companies must maintain readiness to provide expedient global support.

“That company’s responsibility is to be prepared to deploy at any time within 18 hours,” Fenderson said. 

Both companies refined a variety of skills during Battle Focus, ranging from mounted movement to ground tactics.

“Basically combine Bradley movement with dismounted movement and put it all together to try to accomplish the mission,” said 1st Lt. Derek Cobb, platoon leader of Company A.

To prepare for Battle Focus, the attached companies took every opportunity to train.

“Before we came out here we had classes led by our [non-commissioned officers],” Cobb said. “For example, our aid and liter teams would get with the company medic and do practices on how to deal with bleeding.” 

“At the end of [physical training], squad leaders would take guys and go through bounding and do a quick react to contact once we finished doing our cool down stretches,” Cobb continued.

Cobb said the Soldiers always stayed focused, putting their personal thoughts to the side and made sure to complete their mission.

“I think everyone’s secret to success is resiliency because you get hit a lot, especially in the Army, with failures, but you just need to move on,” Cobb said. “We take the hits we get, find out what we can improve upon, and go back out there and execute to the solution.” 

The companies are slated to train at JRTC this spring.",2016/3/10,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/192316/1-30-inf-prepares-armored-companies-irc,"FORT STEWART, GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佐治亚州斯图尔特堡,1-30 Inf.为IRC准备装甲连,3月6日至15日，第三步兵师第二步兵旅战斗队第30步兵团第1营领导在佐治亚州斯图尔特堡进行了战斗集中。战斗集中是一次营级训练演习，目的是为第二营a连和B连做好准备，在路易斯安那州波尔克堡联合战备训练中心，第三身份的第七步兵团，第一装甲旅战斗队，作为支持全球反应部队的即时准备连进行验证。“在一天结束时，你有一支部队能够以任何能力和任何类型的环境进行训练和战斗。”指挥官昆廷・芬德森少校，1-30中程导弹的高级应征顾问说。装甲公司于2016年2月16日加入了1-30中程导弹，为IRC进行训练。“最初，我们试图将所有这些不同的事情落实到位，我们必须建立这些关系，以使这一切顺利进行，”芬德森说。“一个轻型营很少有机会训练一个机械化营，但这是一个很好的经验教训，也了解了布莱德利战车的火力。”通过担任IRC角色，装甲连必须随时准备提供权宜的全球支持。“该连的责任是准备在18小时内随时部署，”芬德森说。这两个连在战斗重点期间改进了各种技能，从骑乘移动到地面战术。“基本上，布莱德利移动和徒步移动相结合，并将其全部结合起来，以完成任务。”A连排长第一中尉德里克・科布（Derek Cobb）说，为了准备战斗重点，附属连抓住每一个机会进行训练。“在我们来到这里之前，我们的班由我们的（士官）领导，”科布说。“例如，我们的救援队和后勤队将与连队医务人员联系，并就如何处理出血问题进行练习。”“在[体能训练]结束时，班长会带着队员进行跳跃训练，并在我们完成冷却伸展训练后对联系做出快速反应。”科布继续说。科布说，士兵们总是保持专注，把他们的个人想法放在一边，确保完成他们的任务。“我认为每个人成功的秘诀都是恢复力，因为你经常受到失败的打击，特别是在军队中，但你只需要继续前进，”科布说。“我们接受我们受到的打击，找出我们可以改进的地方，然后回到那里执行解决方案。”这些公司计划今年春天在JRTC进行培训。
186,30 years later trees still sprout impact,"FORT CAMPBELL, Ky. C To any passerby, the trees planted on the corner of Screaming Eagle Blvd. and Tennessee Ave. at Fort Campbell may just appear to be an ordinary, insignificant grove.

To 101st Airborne Soldiers and veterans, the meaning of those trees are as deep-rooted as the foundation they have sprouted on.

And to think, it all started with a letter. 

In June of 1985, Soldiers with Task Force 3rd Battalion, 502nd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, embarked on a peacekeeping mission to South Camp in Sinai, Egypt. The mission included an operation with the Multinational Force and Observer, in which the Task Force played a vital role in monitoring the interactions between Egypt and Sinai.

Task Force Soldiers did what any Soldiers on mission do C exactly what they are told, until it was time for them to head back to the country they loved so much that they were willing to sacrifice time away from their families. 

For 248 of those Soldiers, so much more than time was sacrificed. 

On the frigid, early morning of December 12, 1985, Soldiers with the Task Force boarded Arrow Air Flight 1285 in Newfoundland, Canada. It was the final layover before they were set to arrive home at Fort Campbell, Kentucky C just in time for the Christmas. 

The plane was no higher than 1,000 feet in the air, and less than one mile from the take-off strip before it stalled and crashed, killing all crew-members and Screaming Eagle Soldiers on board. 

News of the tragedy spread throughout the world. 

“There are no survivors,” said then 2nd Brigade Combat Team commander Col. John Herrling to family members patiently awaiting their Soldiers’ return. 

""Love is never wasted, love is never lost, love lives on and sees us through sorrow,"" said President Ronald Reagan to the Nation. 

“What can I do to help,” asked Janice Nikkel, an Oakville, Ontario native, who was 15 at the time of the crash. 
Nikkel, like any other 15 year old girl, was concerned with boys, friends, and High School at the time of the crash. The impact of the tragedy didn’t resonate with her until her mother put it in perspective. 

Nikkel said her mother compared the catastrophe to the Fort Campbell community to how it would be if 10 classrooms full of students at Nikkel’s school passed away right before Christmas.

“Wow,” said Nikkel. “That was a significant loss. I asked her what Canadians were doing about this and she said she didn't know,” Nikkel said.

Nikkel thought long and hard formulating ideas on what she could possibly do at the ripe age of 15 to reach out to these families.

""I wrote a letter to our big Toronto Star newspaper and said I would like to donate my babysitting money to [buy trees] to plant as a living memorial to these Soldiers who died in our country,"" she said. ""I thought 'I'm 15 years old, what can I do'. But it was something.""

The small, albeit meaningful, gesture reached out to more than just the Fort Campbell community. 

Donations started pouring in. What started as a $20 contribution from Nikkel’s babysitting, rapidly became over $1,700 in donations from celebrities and officials from around the world. Frank Lockyear, the then president of ReTree International, and Howard Stennson of Sheridan Nursery, reached out to Nikkel to see what he can do to make her wish a reality. 

In less than a year, Nikkel and her family were standing on Fort Campbell grass planting 256 Canadian Maple Trees - 8 for every crew member that perished, and 248 to represent every Soldier that passed on that fateful morning.

“I had the privilege of speaking before over 1000 Soldiers and Family Members in a service that dedicated a new forest of trees as a living memorial for these soldiers who died in our country of Canada”, said Nikkel.

Nikkel spent the day in September of 1986 with the Commanding General of the 101st Airborne Division at the time, Maj. Gen. Burton Patrick.

""To be forgotten is to die in vain,"" Patrick said. ""Today [Janice and her fellow Canadians] have seen to it that our fallen Soldiers will not be forgotten.""

Patrick, Nikkel and her family toured Fort Campbell, of course stopping at what this Division and Installation is known for C the Sabalauski Air Assault School. 

“They made me an honorary member that day,” said Nikkel.
Nikkel said it is her family’s tradition to plant trees in honor of loved ones lost. 

Bringing that tradition to honor those Soldiers killed impacted so many Gold Star families in ways Nikkel could not begin to imagine. 

“I didn’t know them personally, but they would put their arms around me and just weep on my shoulder,” said Nikkel. “Here I was 16 years old and just feeling their grief in a way I could never imagine. Up to that time I hadn’t lost anyone close to me besides grandparents and that’s the right order. It’s not the right order when the person lost is 18 or 19 years old.”

Nikkel received letters from former President Reagan and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, praising her for her genuine and heartfelt gesture.

“My special commendation goes to Frank Lockyear of ReTree International, to the Louisiana-Pacific Corporation and to Janice Johnston whose dream of an appropriate tribute is here fulfilled,"" Reagan wrote. ""Let these trees stand as a visible reminder that America is the land of the free only because it has been the home of the brave.""
“Not only will the forest stand as a memorial to the men and women who lost their lives in this tragedy, but it will also serve to remind us all of the need to continue their mission of peace,” said Mulroney in his letter. “The concern shown for our fellow global citizens by young people such as yourself, fills me with confidence that Canada’s future will lie in compassionate and understanding hands.”

Nikkel, her husband and her children visited the grove again in 2010. The influence her donation made decades ago, still reverberates with loved ones today. 

“At the security gate, the gate guard asked me the purpose of my visit to Fort Campbell,” said Nikkel. 

“I told her I wanted to show my kids the trees I'd helped plant 25 years ago. She dropped everything, looked me in the eye and said, ‘My cousin was on that plane. Thank you so much for doing what you did’,” said Nikkel. 

“She got teary, I got teary. I couldn't believe the impact was still felt so deeply,” said Nikkel.

The 30th anniversary of Gander is this December, and a planning team has been organized to commemorate the event. 

The trees still stand strong that corner, and plaques adorn them with names honoring each person who died that morning. 

""I'm very humbled by the whole thing because there was so many people who made it happen,"" Janice said. ""It took one letter. Sometimes that's all it takes.""",2015/8/28,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/174825/30-years-later-trees-still-sprout-impact,"FORT CAMPBELL, KY, UNITED STATES",[],[],坎贝尔堡，肯塔基州，美国,30年后，树木仍在发芽,肯塔基州坎贝尔堡――对任何过路人来说，这些树种植在尖叫鹰大道的拐角处。而在坎贝尔堡田纳西大街可能只是一个普通的、无足轻重的小树林。对于第一百零一名空降兵和退伍军人来说，这些树的意义和他们萌芽的根基一样根深蒂固。1985年6月，第101空降师第2旅战斗队第502步兵团特遣部队第3营的士兵开始了前往埃及西奈南部营地的维和任务。此次任务包括与多国部队和观察员一起开展的一项行动，在这项行动中，特遣部队在监测埃及和西奈半岛之间的互动方面发挥了至关重要的作用。特遣部队士兵做了任何执行任务的士兵都做的事情――也就是他们被告知的事情，直到他们回到他们深爱的国家，愿意牺牲离开家人的时间。对于248名士兵来说，牺牲的不仅仅是时间。1985年12月12日清晨，天气寒冷，特遣部队的士兵在加拿大纽芬兰登上了阿罗航空公司1285航班。这是他们在肯塔基州坎贝尔堡回家前的最后一次停留，刚好赶上圣诞节。飞机在空中的高度不超过1000英尺，距离起飞带不到一英里，就熄火坠毁，机上所有机组人员和尖叫的鹰兵全部遇难。悲剧的消息传遍了全世界。“没有幸存者，”当时的第二旅战斗队指挥官约翰・赫尔林上校对耐心等待士兵归来的家人说。罗纳德・里根总统对全国人民说：“爱永远不会被浪费，爱永远不会失去，爱会永存，会帮助我们渡过难关。”。“我能做些什么来帮助你呢？”安大略省奥克维尔人Janice Nikkel问道，她在坠机时只有15岁。Nikkel和其他15岁的女孩一样，在坠机时关心男孩、朋友和高中。直到她母亲正确地看待这场悲剧，她才对悲剧的影响产生共鸣。Nikkel说，她的母亲将这场灾难与坎贝尔堡社区相比，如果Nikkel学校的10间教室里挤满了学生在圣诞节前去世，情况会如何。“哇，”Nikkel说。“这是一个重大的损失。我问她加拿大人对此做了什么，她说她不知道，”Nikkel说。Nikkel思考了很长很艰难的想法，她可以在15岁的时候做些什么来接触这些家庭。她说：“我给我们的《多伦多星报》写了一封信，说我想把我的保姆钱捐给[买树]来种植，作为对这些在我国牺牲的士兵的活的纪念。我想‘我15岁了，我能做些什么’。”。但这是一件大事。这一虽小但有意义的举动不仅惠及了坎贝尔堡社区。捐款开始大量涌入。尼克尔的保姆一开始捐助了20美元，但很快就从世界各地的名人和官员那里得到了超过1700美元的捐款。时任ReTree International总裁的弗兰克・洛克伊尔（Frank Lockyear）和谢里登托儿所的霍华德・斯坦森（Howard Stennson）联系了尼克，想看看他能做些什么来实现她的愿望。在不到一年的时间里，Nikkel和她的家人站在坎贝尔堡的草地上，种下了256棵加拿大枫树――每一名遇难的机组人员种8棵，每一名士兵在那个决定性的早晨死去248棵。“我有幸在1000多名士兵和家庭成员面前发表讲话，为在我国加拿大牺牲的士兵们奉献了一片新的树林作为活的纪念。”1986年9月，尼克尔与当时101空降师的指挥官伯顿・帕特里克少将共度了一天。帕特里克说：“被遗忘就是白白死去。今天（贾妮斯和她的加拿大同胞们）已经意识到，我们阵亡的士兵不会被遗忘。”帕特里克、尼克尔和她的家人参观了坎贝尔堡，当然也参观了这个以萨巴劳斯基空袭学校而闻名的分部和设施。“那天他们让我成为了荣誉成员。”Nikkel说。Nikkel说，她家族的传统是为逝去的亲人种树。把这一传统带到那些被杀害的士兵身上，以Nikkel无法想象的方式影响了这么多金星家族。“我个人并不认识他们，但他们会搂着我，在我肩上哭泣。”Nikkel说，“我当时16岁，只是以一种我无法想象的方式感受到他们的悲伤。到那时为止，除了祖父母外，我还没有失去任何与我亲近的人，这是正确的顺序。当失去的人是18或19岁时，这不是正确的顺序。”Nikkel收到前总统里根和前加拿大总理布赖恩・穆罗尼的来信，赞扬她真诚的姿态。“我特别赞扬ReTree International的弗兰克・洛克伊尔、路易斯安那太平洋公司和Janice Johnston，他们在这里实现了适当致敬的梦想，里根写道：“让这些树木清晰地提醒我们，美国是自由之地，只是因为它是勇敢者的家园。”“这片森林不仅将成为在这场悲剧中丧生的男女的纪念碑，还将提醒我们所有人需要继续他们的和平使命。”马尔罗尼在信中说：“像你这样的年轻人对我们全球公民同胞的关心让我充满信心，相信加拿大的未来将掌握在富有同情心和理解力的手中。”Nikkel、她的丈夫和孩子们在2010年再次参观了这片小树林。几十年前她的捐赠所产生的影响至今仍在亲人中回荡。“在安全门前，门卫问我去坎贝尔堡的目的，”Nikkel说。“我告诉她，我想让我的孩子们看看25年前我帮助种下的树。她放下所有东西，看着我的眼睛说，‘我表妹在那架飞机上。非常感谢你所做的一切’，”尼克尔说。“她哭了，我哭了。我不敢相信这种影响仍然如此深刻。”Nikkel说。甘德的30周年纪念日是今年12月，已经组织了一个计划团队来纪念这一事件。树仍然矗立在那个角落，牌匾上写着纪念那天早上死去的每个人的名字。“我对这一切感到非常谦卑，因为有这么多人促成了这一事件。”珍妮丝说，“只花了一封信，有时候就这么多了。”
187,Gunner Vitale retires after 30 years of service,"JACKSONVILLE, N.C. - “All I ever wanted to do was to be a Marine,” said Chief Warrant Officer 5 Nicholas V. Vitale, Marine Gunner with the Ground Combat Element Integrated Task Force. “I would see my dad and all his friends, and I’m like ‘oh yeah, that’s what I want to do.’” 

Having grown up near Naval Air Stations, where his father was stationed and Marines guarded the gates, Vitale said he dreamt of being a Marine since he was five years old. In his teens, in February 1985, Vitale stepped on the yellow footprints at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, went through the rigorous training of boot camp, and shortly after was able to call himself a United States Marine. 

“I’ve been a Marine since I was 19, and I’ve been wearing the uniform more than half my life,” Vitale said. “I am a firm believer that everything in the Marine Corps has a shelf life, whether it’s an M16A1 or a PRC-77. When they were new, they were great, and we used the hell out of them. I am the modern day version of a PRC-77 C I’m old. It’s time to turn this over to folks who can take us to the next chapter in the Marine Corps.” 

More than 30 years later, Vitale closed the chapter of his Marine Corps career as he stood in front of his family, friends and fellow Marines, at W.P.T. Hill Field, Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, during his retirement ceremony, June 18, 2015.  

“This is a day I will remember for the rest of my life,” Vitale said. “It is a bittersweet day, but it is my time to go. I will miss putting on the uniform every day and knowing that I’m a part of a martial organization that is so much more than the mere sum of its parts. I don’t know if I’ll miss the Marine Corps as much as I will miss the individual Marines.” 

Vitale has come across many Marines throughout his career, as he served both as an enlisted Marine and Marine officer. Vitale reached the rank of gunnery sergeant before he was commissioned as a warrant officer, and continued his career as a Marine Gunner. 

“Nick, I first met you when I was a young captain and you were a young staff sergeant,” said Col. Matthew G. St. Clair, GCEITF Commanding Officer. “Our paths came along again at 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, and that was when I knew you as a gunner, and that is when your impact on me stayed.”

Throughout the years, St. Clair said the two kept in touch and St. Clair would turn to Vitale for his guidance and mentorship. Vitale’s last tour of duty before retiring was spent at the GCEITF C where he continued to teach and mentor Marines who came his way. 

“Over the past year, it’s like I’ve stood next to a brother,” said St. Clair as he addressed Vitale during the ceremony. “I couldn’t have asked for a better gunner to be here (at the GCEITF) to lead us through this last year and to have the impact you’ve had on these Marines and the impact they will have on the service. It’s been a pleasure, brother.” 

Marine leaders amongst the crowd in attendance, fulfilling capacities as staff noncommissioned officers and field grade officers and up, stood as a testament to the legacy in the Marines Vitale has advised, trained and led, not only at the Task Force, but throughout his 30-year career.   

“Marines are why real leaders stay in the Marine Corps C because they love teaching, coaching and mentoring,” Vitale said. “I fully intended to do a full career, whether it was 20 or 30 years. Marines are the finest creatures on the face of the planet, and to be considered part of their mentoring and learning process, that’s the biggest rush there is.”",2015/6/25,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/168192/gunner-vitale-retires-after-30-years-service,"JACKSONVILLE, NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国北卡罗来纳州杰克逊维尔,枪手维塔莱在服役30年后退休,杰克逊维尔，N.C.-“我一直想做的就是成为一名海军陆战队，”地面战斗分队综合特遣部队海军陆战队炮手、首席准尉5尼古拉斯・V・维塔莱（Nicholas V.Vitale）说。“我会看到我爸爸和他所有的朋友，我会说‘哦，是的，这就是我想做的事’。”维塔尔在海军航空站附近长大，父亲驻扎在那里，海军陆战队守卫着大门。他说，他从五岁起就梦想成为一名海军陆战队队员。1985年2月，维塔莱十几岁时，在海军陆战队新兵基地帕里斯岛踩上了黄色的脚印，接受了新兵训练营的严格训练，不久后，他就可以自称为美国海军陆战队。维塔莱说：“我从19岁起就是一名海军陆战队队员，我的大半辈子都穿着军装。”。“我坚信海军陆战队的每件东西都有保质期，不管是M16A1还是PRC-77。当它们是新的时候，它们非常棒，我们使用了它们。我是PRC-77的现代版本――我已经老了。是时候把它交给那些可以带领我们进入海军陆战队下一个篇章的人了。”30多年后，2015年6月18日，在北卡罗莱纳州海军陆战队大本营Lejeune的W.P.T.Hill Field，Vitale在他的退休仪式上站在家人、朋友和海军陆战队同伴面前，结束了他的海军陆战队生涯。维塔莱说：“这一天我将终生铭记。”。“这是一个苦乐参半的日子，但我该走了。我会怀念每天穿上军装，知道自己是一个军事组织的一员，而这个军事组织不仅仅是其各个部分的总和。我不知道我是否会像怀念单个海军陆战队那样怀念海军陆战队。”维塔莱在他的职业生涯中遇到过许多海军陆战队士兵，因为他同时担任应征海军陆战队和海军陆战队军官。维塔莱在被任命为准尉之前，已晋升为炮兵中士，并继续他的海军陆战队炮手生涯。GCEITF指挥官马修・G・圣・克莱尔上校说：“尼克，我第一次见到你是在我还是一名年轻的上尉时，你是一名年轻的上士。”。“我们的道路在海军陆战队第四远征旅再次出现，那是我认识你作为一名枪手的时候，也是你对我的影响持续的时候。”多年来，圣克莱尔说，两人保持着联系，圣克莱尔将向维塔莱寻求指导和指导。维塔莱退休前的最后一次执勤是在GCEITF度过的――在那里，他继续教授和指导前来的海军陆战队。“在过去的一年里，我好像站在一个兄弟旁边，”圣克莱尔在仪式上向维塔莱致辞时说。“我不可能要求一个更好的炮手在这里（在GCEITF）带领我们度过去年的这段时间，并对这些海军陆战队产生影响，以及他们将对服务产生的影响。这是一种荣幸，兄弟。”出席的人群中的海军陆战队领导人，作为参谋士官和野战级军官以及更高级别的军官，维塔莱不仅在特遣部队，而且在其30年的职业生涯中，为海军陆战队提供咨询、培训和领导，这证明了他在海军陆战队中的遗产。维塔莱说：“海军陆战队是真正的领导者留在海军陆战队的原因，因为他们热爱教学、辅导和指导。”。“我完全打算做一个完整的职业生涯，不管是20年还是30年。海军陆战队是这个星球上最优秀的生物，被认为是他们指导和学习过程的一部分，这是最大的冲刺。”
188,30-year DA civilian supports military through pageant,"By Norman Shifflett 

Fort Carson Public Affairs Office

FORT CARSON, Colo. ― Cathy Howell never expected to be Mrs. Colorado Springs at this point in her life.

Howell is a Department of the Army (DA) civilian, having served the military community for 30 years, 12 of those at Fort Carson. 

Howell serves Fort Carson as a physical security specialist with the Directorate of Emergency Services (DES), and she was also selected as Mrs. Colorado Springs, recently. 

However, Howell did not join the pageant for her own benefit, she joined because she is very passionate about taking care of Soldiers and Family members.

“Being around the military is all I know,” said Howell.

Her father was a World War II veteran who taught her to respect the U.S. and the military service members who defend the country. Even as a little girl, Howell said she has always wanted to join the Army. However, when the time came, she was unable to join due to preexisting medical conditions.

When she was unable to join the Army, she decided she could still serve as a DA civilian. Howell, now having served nearly three decades, said she can’t imagine not being a part of the military community. 

Joining this year’s pageant was not done on a whim. Howell grew up in Colorado Springs and competed in several pageants when she was younger. Her experience in pageants helped her decide to use the Mrs. Colorado Springs pageant to share her platform of serving the military. The contestants were allowed to choose which cause they wished to represent in their platform. 

When she approached her husband about joining the pageant, he said he supported her completely. Howell is married to Retired Chief Warrant Officer 4 Micah Howell, who currently serves as a supervisory security specialist for Fort Carson’s security and access control division, DES. 

“I thought that it was an excellent opportunity for her to represent Colorado Springs,” said Micah Howell. “Now she is competing for Mrs. Colorado and that brings attention to her efforts of supporting the military, Colorado Springs, and, it brings attention to the military community.”

The Howells have been married for over 20 years, and during that time, she has been very active in the Soldier Family Readiness Group (SFRG) helping Soldiers and their Families. 

After 9/11, Cathy Howell said she knew there was something else she could do to support the military. 

She volunteered as a DA civilian to deploy for her first and only deployment to Afghanistan from November 2015 to November 2016. During her deployment, she was able to have an experience similar to Soldiers. Upon returning from the deployment, she brought back knowledge that many spouses of deployed Soldiers did not have. She shared that knowledge with spouses helping them understand what their deployed Soldiers might be going through.

Her duties didn’t end there.

Cathy Howell volunteers to help Soldiers and their Families as an SFRG senior adviser to the 759th Military Police Battalion commander.

Because of her volunteer efforts, she is known by Joey Bautista, Fort Carson volunteer services manager.

Bautista has known Cathy Howell since she began working at Fort Carson, about 12 years. Not only does Bautista know her through her volunteering on Fort Carson, but also through her full-time position. She conducts Batista’s physical security inspections and provides him with updated physical security materials.

“She is a very professional and respectful person,” said Bautista. “The passion is always in her heart. Cathy Howell is a wonderful person and is always there for anyone who needs her.”

Cathy Howell said she believes her passion for the military is what earned her selection as Mrs. Colorado Springs.

Now she has the opportunity to become Mrs. Colorado, having learned anyone who held a city title could compete for Mrs. Colorado. 

The Mrs. Colorado pageant will take place in June 2021.

Through her pageant duties, Cathy Howell wants to draw attention to the military, and she hopes to continue bringing light to the military community as Mrs. Colorado during her journey.

“It is important to me to win this pageant because I want to get my platform out there,” said Cathy Howell. “For me, the best way to do that was to see if there was another pageant out there so I could get my platform out there and share it with others.”

She said she doesn’t want the community to forget about the military and all they are still doing here with COVID-19 support and the service members deployed overseas.

“We still need their love and support,” said Cathy Howell.",2021/4/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/398168/30-year-da-civilian-supports-military-through-pageant,UNITED STATES,[],[],美国,30年来，地方检察官通过选美支持军队,诺曼・希夫莱特・卡森堡公共事务办公室科罗拉多州卡森堡-凯西・豪厄尔从来没有想过在她生命的这一刻成为科罗拉多州的斯普林斯夫人。豪厄尔是陆军部（DA）的一名平民，在军事社区服务了30年，其中12年在卡森堡。豪厄尔在卡森堡担任紧急服务理事会（DES）的物理安全专家，最近她还被选为科罗拉多斯普林斯夫人。然而，豪厄尔并不是为了自己的利益而参加这次选美，她之所以参加选美，是因为她非常热衷于照顾士兵和家庭成员。豪厄尔说：“我所知道的一切都是在军队中度过的。”她的父亲是二战退伍军人，他教会她尊重美国和保卫国家的军人。豪厄尔说，即使在她还是个小女孩的时候，她就一直想参军。然而，当时机成熟时，她由于先前存在的医疗条件而无法参军。当她无法参军时，她决定她仍然可以作为地方检察官。豪厄尔现在已经服役近三十年了，她说她无法想象不成为军事界的一员。参加今年的选美比赛不是一时兴起的。豪厄尔在科罗拉多斯普林斯长大，年轻时曾参加过几次选美比赛。她在选美比赛中的经历帮助她决定利用科罗拉多州斯普林斯夫人选美比赛来分享她为军队服务的平台。参赛者被允许选择他们希望在自己的平台上代表的事业。当她向丈夫提出参加选美时，他说他完全支持她。豪厄尔与退休的首席准尉4米卡・豪厄尔结婚，米卡・豪厄尔目前担任卡森堡安全和访问控制部门的监督安全专家。“我认为这是她代表科罗拉多州斯普林斯的绝佳机会，”米卡・豪厄尔说。“现在，她正在竞选科罗拉多夫人，这引起了人们对她支持军队的努力的关注，科罗拉多斯普林斯，这也引起了人们对军事界的关注。”豪厄尔夫妇结婚20多年，在此期间，她一直积极参加士兵家庭准备小组（SFRG）帮助士兵和他们的家人。911事件后，凯西・豪厄尔说她知道她还可以做些别的事情来支持军队。2015年11月至2016年11月，她自愿作为陆军部文职人员首次也是唯一一次部署到阿富汗。在她的部署过程中，她有了类似士兵的经历。从部署回来后，她带回了部署士兵的许多配偶没有的知识。她与配偶分享这些知识，帮助他们了解部署的士兵可能正在经历的事情。她的职责并没有到此为止。凯西・豪厄尔（Cathy Howell）作为第759宪兵营指挥官的SFRG高级顾问，自愿帮助士兵及其家人。由于她的志愿努力，乔伊・鲍蒂斯塔（Joey Bautista）认识了她，卡森堡志愿者服务经理。鲍蒂斯塔自从凯西・豪厄尔开始在卡森堡工作大约12年后就认识她了。鲍蒂斯塔不仅通过她在卡森堡的志愿工作认识她，还通过她的全职工作认识她。她负责巴蒂斯塔的人身安全检查，并向巴蒂斯塔提供最新的人身安全材料。“她是一个非常专业和尊敬的人，”鲍蒂斯塔说。“激情永远在她的心中。凯西・豪厄尔是一个非常棒的人，总是在那里为任何需要她的人服务。”凯西・豪厄尔说，她相信她对军队的热情是她被选为科罗拉多斯普林斯夫人的原因。现在她有机会成为科罗拉多斯普林斯夫人，了解到任何拥有城市头衔的人都可以竞争科罗拉多夫人。科罗拉多夫人选美比赛将于2021年6月举行。凯西・豪厄尔希望通过她的选美职责，引起军方的注意，她希望在她的旅程中，作为科罗拉多夫人，继续为军事界带来光明。“赢得这场选美比赛对我来说很重要，因为我想在那里找到我的平台。”凯茜・豪厄尔说。“对我来说，最好的办法是看看是否还有另一场选美比赛，这样我就可以把我的平台拿出来与其他人分享。”她说，她不想让社区忘记军队以及他们在新冠肺炎-19支持下仍然在这里做的一切，以及部署在海外的军人。“我们仍然需要他们的爱和支持，”凯西・豪厄尔说。
189,"DNWS commandant retires, reflects upon 30 years of service","The Defense Nuclear Weapons School, established in 1947 at Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., said goodbye Aug. 28, 2020, to its 30th commandant.

Col. Mark E. Bowen, who entered the Air Force in 1990 as an intercontinental ballistic missile launch officer, ceremonially retired here after 30 years of service, the last four as the school’s commandant. 

As the leader of DNWS, Bowen ensured the school effectively educated, trained and supported all agencies and responders to a nuclear or radiological incident or accident. During his tenure, more than 100,000 students attended in-residence or took online DNWS courses. He gives credit for many of his achievements to those he worked with along the way.

“Several events in my career benefited me as commandant,” Bowen said. “I started in ICBMs and learned how the operators do the mission at the ground level, which served as a great start to my career. In the nuclear enterprise, you have to follow the written directives, no matter what. You have to comply with guidance until it is changed, and that mindset needs to be instilled in education and training across the force.”

Growing up in the nuclear enterprise, Bowen was able to see how many organizations operated and succeeded, which helped him make the DNWS even more successful. 

“Early in my career, I got to spend time with Minot (Air Force Base) maintenance teams in the field, observe what they did and how they did it at that level. Then in my first joint assignment at U.S. Strategic Command, I got the ‘big picture’ perspective, beyond the operational unit level. That was very helpful. I followed that with assignments in Space Command and acquisitions, which helped me be a better officer and manager of the Defense Nuclear Weapons School.” 

When Bowen arrived at DNWS in 2016, following his command experiences, he says he understood the direction to take the school and what the product needed to be as part of a combat support agency. The legacy he leaves at DNWS benefits the Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force. He said he leaves with many good memories. 

“I don’t believe there’s a bad assignment out there,” he said. “It’s the people that make the difference, and every part of the mission is important.”

Maj. Gen. Christopher E. Craige, the commander of the Air Force Personnel Center, Joint Base San Antonio-Randolph, Texas, presided over Bowen’s retirement ceremony. He and Bowen have known each other for the past nine years. 

“He is a man of extreme character,” Craige said of Bowen during the ceremony. “Leader, mentor, friend. That’s what I would sum up for Mark.”

The general said he would see Bowen care about Airmen as though they were family. 

“That’s what sets you apart,” he said.

At DNWS, Bowen said he was repeatedly pleased and impressed by the caliber of people who came to work every day. Whether leaders, instructors, or support staff, he said everyone mattered when it came to meeting the school’s mission, which is to provide education and training in the nuclear enterprise and countering weapons of mass destruction in support of joint service and interagency organizations worldwide. He said it’s the effort of the individuals that makes the school better. 

“Every day, our people made the instructional materials better and more relevant,” Bowen said. “They reached back to their communities from both recent and past assignments to understand the current needs of the operational forces. The expertise of our people is a big part of the DNWS ‘claim to fame,’ and we do our jobs exceptionally well. Not only because we can teach, but because we listen to what the customers and organizations need and then deliver it.” 

An example includes the continuing effort to increase the school’s relevance, particularly to the radiological and nuclear communities. Since the “RN” portion of CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high-yield Explosive) is DNWS’ so-called “bread and butter,” DNWS staff seeks to discover training gaps in the radiological and nuclear fields and then works to fill those gaps. 

“If you want RN training, we are the best in the DOD,” he said.
One organization asked the DNWS to produce a course that highlighted the life of nuclear weapons and the historical processes to keep track of and secure the weapons. 

“We ‘opened doors’ for them to better understand how the DOD addresses, maintains, and secures nuclear weapons,” Bowen said. “The course had immediate impact and helped improve current and future operations across the organization.” 

Although officially retired, Bowen says he’ll continue to support the school.

“Mr. (Vayl) Oxford (Defense Threat Reduction Agency director) is very vocal about including allies and supporting Combatant Commands,” Bowen said. “I’ll continue to open those doors with U.S. Central Command, U.S. Pacific Command, and even in areas where nuclear weapons are not their ‘bread and butter’ but they need to be prepared for conventional/nuclear integration and associated transitions. DNWS will do some great things in the future, preparing our forces and leadership with information that will make them more effective in the nuclear arena.”

To finish a full career in the nuclear enterprise, and at a school that the DOD deems as the premier DOD military multi-service and joint CBRNE training facility, seems fitting. It speaks to his dedication and desire to serve the country, even beyond his time in uniform. 

“I’m honored to have served our nation for 30 years,” Bowen said. “My family is the reason why I served -- to maintain that freedom that we all enjoy. My service to God through my church certainly helped set me up for success, and to be a colonel and a commander was an extraordinary experience.”

190,WVNG update on COVID-19 response 03-30-2020,"Currently, nearly 350 members of the West Virginia National Guard (WVNG) are serving the State of West Virginia by augmenting civil authorities through four lines of effort:
?	Operationalizing of the event
?	Stabilization of the population
?	Logistical movement of critical supplies
?	Information and analytics to combat the virus

“The WVNG continues to make significant headway in positioning our state for a robust response,” stated Maj. Gen. James Hoyer, the Adjutant General of the WVNG. “Our men and women are showcasing the innovation, determination and driving spirit of our force in their actions to assist the State of West Virginia each and every day. As a state, we must continue to band together and support one another in our actions to stop the spread of this virus and flatten the curve. Every action we take in the coming days and weeks will make a significant impact on our capability to protect our most vulnerable and our healthcare workers who are on the front lines of this battle.”

Through continuous partnerships with our State Board of Education, community and technical colleges and business partners, a prototype N95 mask has been developed that is being refined in order to meet the specifications for the medical community. Collectively, we are also looking into innovative ways to meet the in-demand needs of our West Virginia healthcare system to include providing retail-specific training on proper box handling and PPE training for our medical and first responder community.

Since our last update, our logistical element has provided delivery of seven refrigerated trailers to areas around the state that will support feeding missions in Webster, Clay, Lincoln, Braxton, Pocahontas and Ritchie Counties. Additionally, two other missions were conducted to support distribution of 15,000 pre-packaged meals from Tamarack to Mountain View Elementary in Union and Peterstown Elementary in Peterstown. Ten additional Soldiers began working with the Facing Hunger Food Bank in Huntington today and will work seven days a week assisting with food box preparation and distribution.

As of this report, we have received 7,045 gloves; 330 gowns; 31,200 surgical masks; 1,560 N95 masks and 139 coveralls from the national stockpile. Additional shipments are expected in the next 24 hours and the WVNG will facilitate the distribution of these supplies to healthcare facilities around the state alongside the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (WVDHRR) and the West Virginia Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (WVDHSEM).

Our support to educate business partners and the healthcare/first responder communities continue. Beginning tomorrow, the WVNG will provide proper cargo and box handling training to big box retail establishments in the area, with a plan to roll out additional training to restaurants and convenience stores. In Huntington, four Guard personnel will assist with traffic control at a drive through testing site beginning Tuesday. 

This week, seven teams of Guardsmen and women are assisting regional epidemiology centers in the data analysis and contact tracing of COVID-19, which will assist state leaders in decision making for response efforts. The southern region response team facilitated the pickup and delivery of an acute care specimen to the state lab today, enabling expedient processing for rapid response, if necessary. 

The WVNG has conducted the following missions since coming on duty to support the state in all aspects of COVID-19 preparation and response:
	
?	18 Soldiers are providing assistance with food box building and distribution at with the Mountaineer Food Bank and with the Facing Hunger Food Bank in Huntington. 
?	WVNG medical personnel are supporting the COVID-19 hotline in Charleston, answering calls and providing information to concerned citizens. Additional medical personnel are being assigned to provide planning expertise to state agencies in areas such as long-term care facilities, epidemiology and contact tracing support. 
?	23 liaison officers from the WVNG are working hand-in-hand with the various West Virginia agencies who are leading the response to COVID-19 to include the Department of Health and Human Resources, Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, and Department of Education. 
?	The WVNG’s Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive (CBRNE) Battalion, the 35th Civil Support Team (CST), and the 35th Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP) have provided classroom and hands-on personal protective equipment (PPE) instruction to more than 150 first responders and hospital staff from Kentucky and West Virginia, in order to help prepare them on how to minimize cross-contamination through proper wear of, “donning” and “doffing” of PPE.  
?	Five Soldiers provided capabilities for conducting COVID-19 swabs in Morgantown March 23rd and 24th utilizing PAPRs PPE that can be decontaminated and reused, greatly reducing the use of disposable, one-time-use PPE.
?	Soldiers continue to provide logistical support for delivery of PPE from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (WVDHHR) and West Virginia Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (WVDHSEM) to hospitals and health departments. 
?	The WVNG has fielded a network of seven epidemiology teams to assist DHHR with COVID-19 tracking and analytics.
?	We continue to provide logistical pickup and transfer of PAPRs and canisters to various health care networks in the event of a surge of patients.
?	Our CBRN field is facilitating COVID-19 PPE training for retailers, restaurants, convenience stores, health care providers and first responders.
?	Four Soldiers are providing traffic control assistance to a drive through testing facility in Huntington.

All current and future missions performed by the WVNG are a part of a coordinated state-level public health preparation and response effort for the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, initiated by Governor Jim Justice, and being led by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources.

192,"SMDC Soldier, Wounded Warrior reenlists 30 feet underwater","HUNTSVILLE, Alabama C A Redstone Arsenal Soldier, combat veteran and Wounded Warrior with U.S. Army Space and Missile Defense Command/Army Forces Strategic Command, reenlisted 30 feet underwater at the U.S. Space & Rocket Center, Huntsville, Alabama, Aug. 31.
  
U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Michael Brown, currently serving as the aide to USASMDC/ARSTRAT command sergeant major, was introduced to scuba diving as a part of adaptive rehabilitation following the loss of his left leg in 2007 during combat operations in Iraq. He chose the underwater venue of the Space & Rocket Center’s Underwater Astronaut Trainer as a fitting location to marry his two passions, the Army and scuba diving. 
 
“Scuba diving provides a pain-free environment for me to explore the wonders of the ocean, uninhibited by the burdens I feel on the surface from my disability,” Brown said. “This ceremony is where I will dedicate the rest of my career to the needs of the Army.”

Brown lost his leg in 2007 while deployed to Mosul, Iraq, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Just 33 days into that deployment, he lost his left leg after being hit by an RKG-3 anti-tank grenade. Following the incident, he was evacuated to Walter Reed Army Hospital where he was taught to use a specially designed prosthetic leg to scuba dive. Since that time, Brown took advantage of his many Army assignments and personal leave to dive in places such as Puerto Rico, Greece, France and Italy. 

Brown’s ceremony was attended by members of Brown’s family, SMDC Soldiers, coworkers, friends and members of the media. The officiating officer, Lt. Col. Gary Blount, read Brown the oath of enlistment using specialized full-face scuba masks with built-in communication. Following the underwater ceremony, Brown spoke to the gathered crowd and media on what scuba diving gave him after his injuries.

“It taught me to think outside the box, what my new normal could be. How many amputees do you know that go skydiving, scuba diving, rock climbing and mountain biking?” said Brown. “I had to readjust my idea of the word disabled, and I could not have done that without the support of my family and my friends.”",2018/9/7,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/291877/smdc-soldier-wounded-warrior-reenlists-30-feet-underwater,"HUNTSVILLE, AL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国阿尔卑斯州亨茨维尔,SMDC士兵，受伤的战士，潜入水下30英尺,阿拉巴马州亨茨维尔――8月31日，在阿拉巴马州亨茨维尔的美国航天与火箭中心，一名红石兵工厂士兵、美国陆军航天与导弹防御司令部/陆军战略司令部的战斗老兵和受伤战士重新入选水下30英尺的名单。美国陆军参谋长迈克尔・布朗中士（Michael Brown）目前担任USASMDC/ARSTRAT司令部中士少校的助手，2007年在伊拉克作战行动中失去左腿后，作为适应性康复的一部分，他被介绍参加了水肺潜水。他选择了太空与火箭中心水下宇航员培训师的水下训练场地作为一个合适的地点，将他的两个爱好――军队和水肺潜水结合起来。布朗说：“水肺潜水为我探索海洋奇观提供了一个无痛的环境，不受身体残疾给水面带来的负担的束缚。”。布朗在2007年被派往伊拉克摩苏尔支持“伊拉克自由行动”时失去了一条腿。在部署后仅仅33天，他就被RKG-3反坦克手榴弹击中，失去了左腿。事件发生后，他被疏散到沃尔特・里德陆军医院，在那里他被教导使用一条特别设计的假肢进行水肺潜水。从那时起，布朗利用他的许多军队任务和个人休假到波多黎各、希腊、法国和意大利等地潜水。布朗的家人、SMDC士兵、同事、朋友和媒体成员出席了布朗的仪式。主礼官加里・布朗特中校使用带有内置通讯装置的专用全脸潜水面具宣读了布朗的入伍誓言。在水下仪式结束后，布朗向聚集的人群和媒体讲述了受伤后戴水肺潜水带给他的一切。“这教会了我跳出框框思考，我的新常态可能是什么。你知道有多少截肢者会跳伞、戴水肺潜水、攀岩和山地自行车？”布朗说。“我不得不重新调整我对残疾人这个词的看法，没有家人和朋友的支持，我不可能做到这一点。”
193,NPS’ MOVES Institute Reflects on 30 Years of Virtual Reality,"For the past 30 years, virtual reality has proven to be a foundational technology, one that has completely changed the way humans interact with machines, opening new doors and possibilities that are still being discovered to this day. 

Within the Department of Defense (DOD) the impact has been equally powerful, with VR technology fundamentally changing major functions within the department. At the forefront of this advanced technology, first coined ‘virtual reality’ now 30 years ago, is a small graduate university, the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS), and its Modeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation (MOVES) Institute, where forward-leaning faculty and dedicated students have opened countless doors to uses of VR that are now commonplace throughout the services. 

Soldiers and Marines work out new tactics to engage enemies in myriad complex battlegrounds without firing a shot or taking casualties; pilots can crash over and over again in flight-training simulators; surgeons are able to hone their skills without putting human patients at risk; and students can sit in classrooms hundreds of miles away.

NPS students and faculty have persistently pushed the boundaries of immersive technologies: 3D modeling, artificial intelligence, simulation, human-computer interaction and networking. These technologies have transformed the way the U.S. military does business across such disparate areas as virtual rifle ranges, cyber battlefields, logistics, recruitment and aircraft carrier landings.

“Simply put, virtual reality is the technology for moving through and interacting with a three-dimensional computer-generated environment,” explained Dr. Mike Zyda, founder of the MOVES Institute, the group that has spearheaded NPS’ contributions to the field of VR and how the DOD uses it.

This allows for ever more realistic training simulations. Real world challenges, especially high-risk, hazardous or expensive ones, can be practiced over and over again without real world consequences.

“It’s important to rehearse and know what’s where, where you’re going to do what you’re going to do,” Zyda added. “In the heat of battle, once the flash bang goes off, all of your cognitive functions disappear and what remains in your brain are the things that you’ve trained for.”

NPS formally established the MOVES Institute in 2000 to bridge the military analysis work of its Operations Research Department with the simulation and software development expertise of its Computer Science Department. MOVES had existed as an interdisciplinary academic program since 1996, but its origins run much deeper.

In the early 1980s, NPS students began exploring the creation of 3D virtual environments and games on Silicon Graphics Iris 2400 workstations C cutting edge at the time. In 1986, two students developed a FOG-M anti-tank missile simulator as their graduate thesis. The simulator worked brilliantly, accurately modeling the physical dynamics of the real thing.

The only issue was that fire was directed at a stationary target: tanks on a real battlefield tend not to sit still.

“Wouldn’t it be better if it moved around?” recalled Zyda, the students’ advisor. So they developed a way for the missile and the tank to interact in that 3D world, a network they named NPSNET.

“Now we could drive the tank around to evade the missile,” Zyda said. “Next thing you know, we’re building multiple tanks and driving them around.”

This caught the attention of the U.S. Army, which had recently began exploring tank simulators through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The DARPA effort yielded a system called SIMNET, which came at a hefty $140 million a pop. In contrast, the commercially-available Iris 2400 workstations used by NPS cost $60,000 each.

When the military adopted SIMNET in 1990, few people in the U.S. government understood how to effectively use it, and NPSNET provided a low-cost means to utilize its databases and networking formats. NPS students in the NPSNET group, which would later evolve into the MOVES program, developed hardware and built virtual simulations for a variety of platforms, including aircraft, underwater vehicles, command and control vehicles and forward observers.

“We were doing pioneering things in networking,” Zyda said. “We learned how to build the first fully instrumented body suits that could play across the Internet.”

By 1994, public interest in the Internet had exploded, and startups such as Amazon began their meteoric ascension. 

That’s when NPS broke the internet. 

Working on a demo of networking capability with the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, Calif., they requested a few autonomous vehicles. The Rand Corporation sent 2,000. NPSNET handled these magnificently, but the volume of high-priority information packets between the vehicles crashed the Internet all the way from California to Finland, and NPS was soon flooded with ”amazingly hostile” calls asking them to please stop.

“If you did that today, the FBI would probably show up at your door,” Zyda said. “It was just a little test to see the limits of what we could do ... But you know you’re doing your best research when you break things in a big way.”

Even mistakes can have good results C that’s the good thing about scientific research C and the group, soon flush with funding, sought to formally establish the MOVES Institute.

“We had sponsors who would give us big pieces of money and say, ‘please just help us learn how to do this,” Zyda recalled.

Back then, not everyone, even on the NPS campus, was convinced that VR technology was the wave of the future. But with the backing of a three-star admiral and a guaranteed $2 million per year to run the program, the NPS Academic Council approved the MOVES graduate degree program. 

“All of a sudden, I had 40 students arrive,” Zyda recalled. “We had a budget and took over the second floor of Spanagel Hall.”

In 1997, Zyda chaired a National Research Council study to explore the vast overlap between military simulation and commercial gaming. Their report, Modeling and Simulation: Linking Entertainment and Defense, fundamentally altered DOD’s use of C and attitude towards C entertainment technology in modeling and simulation systems.

This resulted in what would become a grand slam homerun for the MOVES Institute: it became the birthplace of America’s Army, a first-person shooter video game in which players engage in squad-level tactical combat, immersed in realistic, high-quality environments.

It was launched by the Army in 2002 as a free, downloadable recruiting tool and is still going strong with several million active users logging billions of hours of gameplay time.

“It’s the very first serious game that had a big impact. It became one of the top five played games online in the years that it was out and it was the most successful recruiting tool ever built by the U.S. Army,” Zyda said.

Unlike the carnal gore which defines the genre, America’s Army focuses on team-based, coordinated gameplay among characters using accurately modeled weapons systems. In doing so, the game aims to stimulate interest in the Army for potential recruits.

“The fact that NPS was involved in things like America’s Army was really significant because we recognized that you can immerse people to some degree. The whole idea behind America’s Army was envisioning what it would be like to be in the Army and then trying to use that kind of environment to immerse you in a virtual reality,” said Dr. Imre Balogh, current director of the MOVES Institute.

“It’s not just that we cared about a particular technology, but about creating that virtual environment.”
America’s Army was originally intended as a recruitment tool, but has since morphed into a training tool.

Repurposing its engine has enabled a myriad of virtual reality training simulators, including advance gunnery on the M1A2 Abrams, driving Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles, calling for artillery fire and conducting electronic warfare. A 2016 Government Accountability Office report specifically called on the Army to up its game with virtual reality training in order to confront the world’s increasingly complex security environment.

It’s not just Army, though. All services are heavily investing in virtual reality-based training, such as the Navy’s Fleet Integrated Synthetic Training/Testing Facility (FIST2FAC) on Ford Island, Hawaii.

""This is the future of training for the Navy,"" said Terry Allard, head of the Office of Naval Research's Warfighter Performance Department. ""With simulation, you can explore endless possibilities without the expense and logistical challenges of putting hundreds of ships at sea and aircraft in the sky.""

The drive towards virtual reality training is reflective of the efficiency it affords: time, manpower and resources are saved and logistic stress loads lightened. It also provides training opportunities that wouldn’t be possible otherwise, explained Dr. Amela Sadagic, research associate professor with the MOVES Institute.

“A typical example would be emergency procedures for aircraft: some elements of that can be practiced in the real world with real aircraft, but by and large can only be tried and trained in simulators,” she said.

Sadagic cited the thesis work of her former student, Lt. Clay Greunke, as an example. Greunke, a Navy pilot who also served as a Landing Signal Officer (LSO), created a virtual reality training simulator for inexperienced LSOs to practice guiding in aircraft landing on carriers. He had identified a gap in training: LSOs spend a total of six hours in a large, two-story simulator in Oceana, Virginia to work out the fundamentals of landing planes on carriers. Most training occurs on-the-job once new LSOs arrive on a ship, passively observing more seasoned LSOs.

""The first time you go to the aircraft carrier, you have no idea what's going on,"" Greunke said. ""Planes are going by, people are screaming, people are running across the flight deck ... You don't know what to cross, when to cross, what you can and can't do, you are just holding on to the person who's leading you with dear life so you don't get hit.""

So Greunke developed a lightweight, portable kit as a “gym bag solution.” The light-weight virtual reality LSO trainer kit can be taken just about anywhere to better familiarize LSOs with flight deck operations and offer refresher training. 

For his work, he received honorable mention at the 2016 Secretary of the Navy Innovation Awards C Innovation Scholar (Professional Military Education). The winner was fellow NPS graduate student Lt. Brendan Geoghegan, also an advisee of Sadagic, for his thesis on using virtual reality head-mounted displays to augment ship navigation.

Greunke’s and Geogheghan’s work underscores the unique contribution NPS’ MOVES Institute brings to the field. Advanced virtual reality research is by nature interdisciplinary, and while NPS faculty actively collaborate to share insight from a wide variety of fields C from computer vision to cognitive psychology C students bring to the table a wealth of operational and technical expertise from their diverse military careers.

“The students come in with ideas and then start using those because they’re the ones who have the operational background,” Balogh said. “We enable them to understand virtual reality and they then say, 
‘Oh boy, I can see how I can use this to address this particular problem in the military.’ That’s our place.” 

This contrasts sharply with civilian academia throughout the rest of the country. Most university simulation programs emphasize cultivation of new skills, and today that emphasis is on the gaming industry. NPS students, already armed with intimate knowledge of their domains, return to their respective services after graduating, bringing new insights directly to end user communities.

“For me, this is unique compared to my colleagues at other universities; they don’t have this proximity to the end users,” Sadagic said. “When it comes to knowledge of a domain, you can’t replicate that.

“Anything that I want to know about aviation, ship navigation or urban warfare, all I need to do is open the door and somebody will know,” she added. “And we do; we do that to a great extent.”

This creates a critical niche for NPS. Thirty years ago, there weren’t many people exploring virtual reality, which meant NPS could be a big fish in a very small pond. The exponential growth of commercial gaming, however, outpaced the institution’s competitiveness in new technology development.

A company like Microsoft, for example, is able to invest in a single product on orders of magnitude several times greater than the entire NPS annual budget. Yet navigating these waters is not a zero-sum game, and the unique position of the MOVES Institute allows it to integrate new technologies to solving complex problems throughout DOD.

“One of the most important things we can do is bring that taught knowledge into the Navy and DOD,” Balogh said. In some ways, then, NPS can act as a clearinghouse of sorts to bring together often disjointed virtual reality technology in application to training requirements across the services.

“We as an entity can get better connections to those pieces of the fleet. We won’t be able to solve all problems, but we can play the role of making sure that all the different efforts connect,” Balogh added.

This unique aspect of NPS was echoed when the Secretary of the Navy shared vision for the future of the university. Addressing students, faculty and staff in February, the Honorable Richard V. Spencer shared how the Navy, DOD and the nation can capitalize on NPS’ strengths.

“I want this institution to be the primary education and research enterprise, with the private sector, government sector and academia coming together at the research level,” he said. “This institution is a primary incubator for the capabilities that we need now.”",2018/4/11,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/272708/nps-moves-institute-reflects-30-years-virtual-reality,"MONTEREY, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],蒙特利，加利福尼亚州，美国,NPS的移动研究所回顾了30年的虚拟现实,在过去的30年里，虚拟现实已经被证明是一项基础技术，它彻底改变了人类与机器的互动方式，开启了至今仍在被发现的新大门和可能性。在国防部（DOD）内部，这种影响同样强大，VR技术从根本上改变了国防部的主要职能。这项先进技术的最前沿是一所小型研究生大学――海军研究生院（NPS）及其建模、虚拟环境和仿真（MOVES）研究所，30年前首次创造了“虚拟现实”，在这里，前卫的教员和敬业的学生为虚拟现实的使用打开了无数的大门，而虚拟现实在整个服务中已经司空见惯。士兵和海军陆战队制定出新的战术，在无数复杂的战场上与敌人交战，而不会开枪或造成伤亡；飞行员可以在飞行训练模拟器中反复坠毁；外科医生能够磨练他们的技能，而不会使人类患者处于危险之中；学生们可以坐在数百英里以外的教室里。NPS的学生和教员一直在不断地突破沉浸式技术的界限：3D建模、人工智能、仿真、人机交互和网络。这些技术改变了美军在虚拟步枪靶场、网络战场、后勤、征兵和航空母舰着陆等不同领域开展业务的方式。“简言之，虚拟现实是一种在三维计算机生成环境中移动并与之交互的技术，”MOVES Institute的创始人Mike Zyda博士解释说，MOVES Institute是NPS在虚拟现实领域的先驱，也是国防部如何使用它的。这使得训练模拟更加真实。现实世界的挑战，特别是高风险、危险或昂贵的挑战，可以反复练习，而不会产生现实世界的后果。Zyda补充道：“重要的是要排练并知道在哪里，在哪里，你要做什么。”。“在激烈的战斗中，一旦闪电爆炸，你所有的认知功能都会消失，留在你大脑中的就是你训练过的东西。”2000年，NPS正式成立了MOVES研究所，将其作战研究部的军事分析工作与其计算机科学部的仿真和软件开发专业知识联系起来。自1996年以来，MOVES一直是一个跨学科的学术项目，但其起源要深得多。20世纪80年代初，NPS学生开始探索在Silicon Graphics Iris 2400工作站上创建3D虚拟环境和游戏，这是当时的最前沿。1986年，两名学生开发了FOG-M反坦克导弹模拟器作为他们的毕业论文。模拟器工作得非常出色，精确地模拟了真实物体的物理动力学。唯一的问题是，射击是针对一个静止的目标的：在真实战场上的坦克往往不会静止不动。“如果它四处移动不是更好吗？”学生顾问Zyda回忆道。因此，他们开发了一种导弹和坦克在3D世界中互动的方法，他们称之为NPSNET网络。“现在我们可以驾驶坦克绕过导弹，”Zyda说。“下一件事你知道，我们正在建造多辆坦克并驾驶它们四处走动。”这引起了美国陆军的注意，美国陆军最近开始通过国防高级研究计划局（DARPA）探索坦克模拟器。DARPA的努力产生了一个名为SIMNET的系统，该系统的价格高达1.4亿美元。相比之下，NPS使用的商用Iris 2400工作站每台成本为60000美元。当军方在1990年采用SIMNET时，美国政府中很少有人知道如何有效地使用它，NPSNET提供了一种低成本的方法来利用其数据库和网络格式。NPSNET小组的NPS学生后来发展成为MOVES项目，他们为各种平台开发了硬件并构建了虚拟仿真，包括飞机、水下航行器、指挥和控制车辆以及前方观察员。“我们在网络方面做了开创性的事情，”Zyda说。到1994年，公众对互联网的兴趣爆发，亚马逊等初创公司开始了他们的迅速崛起。就在那时，NPS打破了互联网。在加州圣莫尼卡与兰德公司进行联网能力演示时，他们要求购买一些自动驾驶汽车。兰德公司发送了2000份。NPSNET处理这些问题非常出色，但是从加利福尼亚到芬兰，车辆之间的高优先级信息包的数量使互联网一路崩溃，NPS很快就被“令人惊讶的敌意”电话淹没，要求他们停止。“如果你今天这样做，FBI可能会出现在你的门口，”Zyda说。“这只是一个小小的测试，看看我们能做什么的极限……但你知道，当你把事情弄糟的时候，你正在做你最好的研究。”即使是错误也会有好的结果――这是科学研究的好处――该小组很快就获得了充足的资金，寻求正式成立MOVES研究所。“我们有赞助商，他们会给我们一大笔钱，并说，‘请帮助我们学会如何做到这一点，’”Zyda回忆道。当时，并不是所有人，即使是在NPS校园里，都相信虚拟现实技术是未来的潮流。但在一位三星级上将的支持下，以及每年200万美元的担保资金，NPS学术委员会批准了MOVES研究生学位项目。“突然间，我有40名学生来了，”Zyda回忆道：“我们有一个预算，接管了Spanagel大厅的二楼。”1997年，Zyda主持了国家研究委员会的一项研究，以探索军事模拟和商业游戏之间的巨大重叠。他们的报告《建模与仿真：娱乐与防御的联系》从根本上改变了国防部在建模与仿真系统中对娱乐技术的使用和态度。这导致这将成为MOVES Institute的大满贯全垒打：它成为了美国陆军的诞生地，这是一款第一人称射击游戏，玩家可以在真实、高质量的环境中进行班级战术战斗。该游戏于2002年由陆军推出，是一款免费的、可下载的招募工具，目前仍在继续数百万活跃用户记录了数十亿小时的游戏时间。“这是第一款具有重大影响的严肃游戏。它在推出后的几年内成为五大在线游戏之一，也是美国陆军有史以来最成功的招募工具。”Zyda说。与定义这一类型的《肉体戈尔》不同，美国军队专注于使用精确建模的武器系统在角色之间进行基于团队的协调游戏。这样做的目的是激发潜在新兵对军队的兴趣。“NPS参与美国军队等活动的事实非常重要，因为我们认识到，在某种程度上，你可以让人沉浸其中。美国军队背后的整个想法是设想在军队中会是什么样子，然后试图利用这种环境让你沉浸在虚拟现实中。”MOVES研究所现任所长Imre Balogh博士说，“我们不仅关心某项特定技术，还关心创建虚拟环境。”美国陆军最初是作为征兵工具使用的，但后来演变成了一种训练工具。对其引擎的重新调整使无数虚拟现实训练模拟器得以实现，包括M1A2艾布拉姆斯上的先遣炮兵、驾驶防地雷伏击保护车、呼叫火炮射击和进行电子战。2016年政府问责办公室的一份报告特别呼吁陆军加大虚拟现实训练的力度，以应对世界日益复杂的安全环境。但不仅仅是陆军。所有军种都在大力投资基于虚拟现实的训练，如海军的舰队综合合成训练位于夏威夷福特岛的训练/测试设施（FIST2FAC）。“这是海军训练的未来，”海军研究办公室作战人员绩效部门负责人特里・阿拉德说。“通过模拟，你可以探索无限的可能性，而无需花费费用和后勤挑战，将数百艘船只置于海上，将飞机置于空中。MOVES研究所的研究副教授阿米拉・萨达吉克博士解释说：“虚拟现实培训的发展反映了它所提供的效率：节省了时间、人力和资源，减轻了后勤压力。它还提供了否则不可能提供的培训机会。”。“一个典型的例子是飞机的应急程序：其中的一些要素可以在现实世界中用真实的飞机进行实践，但大体上只能在模拟器中进行试验和培训。”她说。萨达奇以她的前学生克莱・格伦克中尉的论文工作为例。格伦克是一名海军飞行员，同时担任着陆信号官（LSO）他创建了一个虚拟现实训练模拟器，供没有经验的当地官员练习在航空母舰上进行飞机着陆指导。他发现了训练中的一个空白：当地官员在弗吉尼亚州奥西纳市的一个两层楼高的大型模拟器中总共花了六个小时来研究飞机在航空母舰上着陆的基本原理。一旦有了新的当地官员，大部分训练都会在工作中进行登上一艘船，被动地观察经验丰富的LSO。“第一次去航空母舰时，你根本不知道发生了什么，”格伦克说。“飞机飞过，人们尖叫着，人们跑着穿过飞行甲板……你不知道该穿越什么，何时穿越，你能做什么，不能做什么，你只是紧紧抓住那个用宝贵生命引导你的人，这样你就不会被击中。”所以
194,"Career Marine recalls 30 years of service to Corps, nation","Maj. Gen. Craig C. Crenshaw, retiring official and commanding general, LOGCOM, said Murphy’s retirement was bittersweet. 
“We are very fortunate to have had Sergeant Major Murphy in our ranks and I say that with the most utmost sincerity,” Crenshaw said. “The impact of what she has done in such a short time for this command is remarkable. Her fingerprints are all over Marine Corps Logistics Command and certainly are all over the Marine Corps.
“She is going to put her boots up,” he continued. “Sergeant Major Murphy is a Marine at heart (but) she does not have to wear the uniform to know that she is a Marine.
“Our Marine Corps is better today because of her and I am better today as an officer having had the privilege to serve with (her) for three years,” he concluded.
According to Murphy, the Marine Corps was not her first choice of military service.
“I chose to join the Navy first because my sister and my daughter's father were in the Navy,” Murphy admitted.  “I was drawn to the Navy because of the people I knew. I showed up at the recruiting station to join and my appointment. 
“When I arrived, the Navy recruiter was not there but a Marine Corps recruiter was standing outside,” she said. “I had no idea what a Marine was. So, I asked him who he was and he said, ‘We are the Marines.’
“I said ‘Oh, what do you have to do to join the Marine Corps?,” she asked. “He went on his spiel and while he was talking I looked down at the bottom of the glass window and there was a quote that said ‘We are looking for a few good men.’
“I looked up at him and said I am looking for the same thing y'all are looking for,” she said. “What do I have to do to join? He moved to the side of the hatch and said ‘volunteer,’ because at that time the Marine Corps was not looking for women.”
In March 1988, the native of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, enlisted and went to boot camp at Parris Island, South Carolina. 
Upon graduating, she attended training at Fort Eustis, Virginia, where she obtained military occupational specialty, traffic management specialist.
Throughout her career, Murphy has been promoted nine times, served in a variety of billets and deployed in harm’s way. 
Her fondest memory was when being a drill instructor at MCRD, Parris Island, South Carolina, where she discovered her purpose in life. 
“Many Americans are patriotic so they join the military,” she said. “It's little bit more than patriotism, it's about giving.
“That's what I learned as a drill instructor and I learned it well enough to instill that into civilians and make them Marines,” she continued. “I wanted to ensure they understand why they joined so it would not take them as long as it did for me to figure it out. This was the turning point in my career.”
In 1999, Murphy, then a staff sergeant, was stationed at Marine Corps Logistics Bases where she served as the staff noncommissioned officer in charge of the Traffic Management Office. 
After an accelerated promotion to the rank of gunnery sergeant, Murphy requested orders to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, to train Naval Officer Candidates. This would be the toughest assignment of her career. 
“I was not accepted or welcomed,” she said. “But like all good Marines do, I pushed forward.”
After completing her first class, Murphy was awarded a Congressional Record by the 107th Congress, honoring her as the first female Marine drill instructor at Naval Officer Candidate School. 
As the end of her career came in to view, she requested to be stationed in Albany one more time.
 “I have been stationed here before so I was comfortable with the location,” she said. “I requested orders to Marine Corps Logistics Command for my last assignment. I thought this would be a good job for me and one I would succeed in because of my understanding and background in logistics.”
In June 2015, Murphy assumed her role as the senior enlisted advisor for LOGCOM. 
 “When you are a sergeant major working for a general officer or colonel, you
want to have some background knowledge in the job so that you don't look like someone who just started learning the (military occupational specialty),” she said. “I came here with the determination of doing the same thing that I have done everywhere else, which is taking care of Marines.
“Although my job was a little bit further away from the Marines than I would
have wanted to be, I was still able to adapt and overcome,” she continued. “Whenever I was not traveling with the general or doing something on the general’s schedule, I got on the Marines' schedule.
“We did professional military education classes with the Marines at the noncommissioned officer level, Staff NCO level and combined,” she pointed out. “I did as many
as I possibly could do. Those PMEs included dinner functions, mess nights and professional dinners.”
Murphy’s plan was to illustrate the Marines the importance of camaraderie.
“I thought bringing the NCOs and Staff NCOs together would give them a better
appreciation of one another,” she stated. “Once they began to appreciate one another, they
worked better together.”
The importance of caring, humbleness, striving for perfection, hard work and dedication is the legacy Murphy wants to leave behind. 
“When you care about someone deeply, you are going to do the right thing for
them whether it means punishment or reward,” she said. “Because a lot of times people
view punishment in a negative manner but they are not always negative. Sometimes there are lessons that need to be taught.
“Part of our Staff NCO Creed in the Marine Corps is to strive for perfection
and we do,” she added. “We are not perfect. There is no perfect person but we strive for
perfection.”
Overall, Murphy described her 30-year career as a “struggle” with blood, sweat, tears, dirt and pain.
“Life is not easy and it's not supposed to be,” she said. “Anything good does not come easy. Marines have a saying, ‘Pain is weakness leaving the body.’ I believe that.  
“If it does, it is not something you want,” she pointed out. “I don't think we get anything easy and honestly it's got to be some hard work involved. The good times you will have in the Marine Corps are the result of caring, humbleness, striving for perfection, hard work and dedication.”
Murphy confessed she is still in disbelief that she is retiring.
“My future plans are to continue to serve, be it the military, taking care of the homeless or a girls school,” she said. “My focus is not on a paycheck but to continue my life of service.”
Until then, her immediate plan is to complete her dissertation to become Dr. Murphy.

195,"Caring for generations of children, Youth Services celebrates 30 years","TOBYHANNA ARMY DEPOT, Pa. ― In the late 1980s a new program director introduced the Army-sponsored In-Home Child Care Program to caregivers living in eight of Tobyhanna Army Depot’s 40 military family housing units. Today she leads a staff of 36 in caring for nearly 300 children in a 20,000 square foot, state-of-the-art facility equipped with computer labs and a multi-purpose sport room.

For 30 years parents have elected to enroll their children in on-post child care programs. In the beginning officials worried if there would be enough interest to support the program. These days Child and Youth Services (CYS) boasts a number of Defense Department certified, state certified and nationally accredited programs for infants, toddlers, preschoolers and teenagers.

Anne Wombacker, CYS coordinator, has been a driving force behind the evolution of the local programs. She’s the one who set things in motion in 1987and recalls there were about 30 children enrolled in the original program. 

The scope of the program has changed; however, the quality of care remains the same. Wombacker says the key to their success is the skilled staff that delivers expert child care to working parents. Classroom and support staff, plus managers, participate in annual, mandatory training. New hires start off with a 40-hour training orientation.

“We’re one of the smallest programs in the Army, which gives us the opportunity to try more things,” she said. “The ultimate goal is to make sure the children are safe, comfortable and happy.”

Programs are always changing, said Wombacker, who pointed out that the current preschool program covers a lot of what people would have seen in a kindergarten class 30 years ago. Staff members are always finding new ways to help the children thrive, she added.

What the children notice is the fun in the fundamental care they receive every day.

“I like doing activities like art,” said one toddler. A 5-year old boy mentioned that he likes to draw and play with toys during school. A couple children claim the train tracks and a large garbage truck are their favorites.  “I just like to play,” said another boy.

Over the years CYS has been able to fine tune a long list of activities available to their target audience. The Little Dragons karate class is still going strong after two years and dozens of children participate in the annual Fun Fitness Day event. Summer Camp is a hit with the school age set; those slots fill up fast. 

Last year, parents were introduced to an open recreation night on every other Thursday; it’s free to anyone enrolled in one of the programs.

“Parents can schedule a date night or shopping trip from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. on those nights,” said Jen Williams, facility director. “We serve the children a light dinner and plan an activity around a theme. The kids really enjoy it.”

First and foremost, staff members are focused on providing a fun, yet challenging, learning environment for the children. Summer hires, college students and local teachers augment CYS capabilities throughout the year. They all love working with children.

“The most rewarding thing for me is when I come to work and the children are excited for the day to begin,” said Yvette, CYS staff member for nine years.

It’s been less than a year since Lisandra joined the staff and she tells everyone the children “brighten” her days. Ten years ago, Patti accepted a job she’s passionate about. She loves it when the children run to greet her every morning and how their eyes light up when learning new things.

“I think the most rewarding part of my job is the impact I have on the children’s lives,” said Jeanette, a nine year veteran. “Encouraging the children to try new things and learn about different things is priceless.”

“They examined ancient quarries where the first people to enter the state mined stone for their weapons and tools, documented the homes and farmsteads of pioneer Families, and rediscovered the remains of the very first infantry maneuvers from Camp Emory Upton in 1909-10,” Woods said. 

Fort McCoy first was called the Sparta Maneuver Tract, which was divided into a maneuver camp named Camp Emory Upton and an artillery camp known as Camp Robinson.

Mark McCarty, chief of the Directorate of Public Works Environmental Division Natural Resources Branch, said the archaeologists’ work benefits both the installation and researchers.

“Fort McCoy’s investment in professional archaeological work has been a huge win-win, simultaneously benefiting the installation, military training, taxpayers, and the scientific community,” he said. “Knowing the locations of sensitive archaeological sites prior to project planning saves the installation vast amounts of time and money.”

Construction and other projects can be approved much more quickly because the archaeological surveys already have been completed, McCarty said. Known archaeological deposits are protected from disturbance, and the likelihood of costly project delays or relocations is greatly reduced.

“We surveyed every safe-to-dig-and-walk inch of Fort McCoy,” Woods said. “Fort McCoy has been very proactive in making sure cultural resources are preserved and understood. That’s why there was more than three decades of phase I and phase II field work.”

Woods said the archaeology effort at Fort McCoy is much different than other archaeology projects in Wisconsin that might take place in conjunction with a transportation project, such as the building of a new highway.

“At Fort McCoy, we know exactly where we are going to be doing projects, and the (archaeology) work has helped produce a very powerful project planning tool,” Woods said. 

“For instance, if someone wants to put in a tank trail somewhere on post, it is a long project that covers a lot of ground and has the potential to interact with some archaeology. Normally, that would be a huge amount of surveying that would need to be done. Now with the planning tool, we can better help planners decide where they should and shouldn’t go with something like a tank trail. So in addition to all of this archaeology work being very cost effective for the military and the taxpayer, it has also produced a wonderful archaeology collection.”

The 30 years of work also has generated a large amount of valuable scientific information as well as hundreds of thousands of archaeological artifacts, which are cared for by the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse, Woods said. The artifacts are available to qualified researchers for study.
 
“There’s probably 100 master’s degree theses waiting to be written if students would get out there,” he said.

Some of the artifacts from the many digs also are displayed at the Fort McCoy History Center, building 902. 

These include a selection of artifacts from Camp Emory Upton and old horseshoes that were found on South Post. 

“Fort McCoy cultural-resources staff will continue to monitor and protect the condition of the installation’s known archaeological sites, working to ensure there is never a conflict between the military training mission and archaeological preservation,” McCarty said.

Recently, in June and July, Woods’ archaeological team embarked on the first phase III dig on the installation’s South Post. The dig was more intensive and produced more artifacts dating back thousands of years.

“This work was much different than the phase I and phase II work,” Woods said. “With the phase III dig, artifacts were getting place-plotted with a laser and marked on how and where the artifact was found. It’s a highly detailed bit of work. The phase III dig also helps us understand bigger questions we’ve had from earlier surveys.”

McCarty reminded everyone that any artifacts spotted while on Fort McCoy or other federal properties should be left alone. It is illegal to dig for or remove artifacts from federally owned land without permission.

197,ARMEDCOM Outgoing Chief of Staff Celebrates 30 Years of Service,"PINELLAS PARK, Fla. C There’s a new beginning for a pillar of the Army Reserve medical community as Col. Elizabeth A. Baker, the Army Reserve Medical Command outgoing chief of staff, recognized her retirement on Aug. 5, 2017, at the C.W. Bill Young Reserve Center in Pinellas Park, Florida. 

ARMEDCOM’s Commanding General, Maj. Gen. Mary Link, officiated the ceremony held in Bakers' honor.  Baker, a Glen Cove, New York native, enters retirement after 30 years of honorable service to the Nation, and has served in increasing roles of responsibility, culminating with her final assignment as chief of staff here at ARMEDCOM.

“Elizabeth has made a tremendous impact not just for ARMEDCOM, but for the entire medical community.  The Army Reserve, the Army and specifically Army Medicine during the thirty years of service she has provided to our Nation.  Her expertise and passion for serving will continue to positively affect our organization for years to come,” Link said.  

Army Reserve Medical Command provides trained, equipped, ready, skill-rich Citizen-Soldiers to meet medical requirements across a full spectrum of military operations.  Concurrently, they provide more than 2,000 Soldiers annually to total force training and mission support, engaged in 64 major exercises across 41 locations designing, executing and assessing individual and collective training while delivering health care to Soldiers and communities around the world.

After receiving the Legion of Merit, Baker spoke of her experiences throughout her career. “Being in the Army, for me, was most certainly an affair of the heart.  As the saying goes, if you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life.  My father liked to put it this way, be like a kindergartner skipping out to recess.  I skip to work every day. . . I'm going to look back at my time in the Army Reserve and the National Guard as some of the most proud and profound and humble moments of my life,” said Baker.

Baker holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance, a Masters of Arts with high honors in security management, and a Masters in strategic studies from the Army War College.

Baker served in all corners of America from New York to Hawaii, and Washington D.C. to Florida along with a deployment to Afghanistan.  She will be joining her husband, Col. Richard G.

198,Embrace the grit-  Ultimate warrior athlete preliminaries June 30,"Jeremy Beale
Staff Writer
For the third year in a row, the High Intensity Tactical Training program (HITT) will answer the question, “Who among the few and proud are the toughest tactical warrior athletes within the Marine Corps?” as instillations across the world host preliminary competitions for a chance to travel to Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, August 28-31, to compete in the HITT finals to prove who is the best of the best.  
Marine Corps Base Quantico’s HITT program will host its final preliminary June 30 from 8?10:30 a.m. at Butler Stadium.
The competition is open to active duty Marines only and every Marine will participate on an individual basis in their Marine issued boots and utes.
Preliminary events will be facilitated and validated by the HITT program coordinator, as no deviation from the preliminary event protocols will be allowed.
Marines who participate must have command approval and a complete registration form submitted to the installation HITT program coordinator prior to the preliminary event June 30; otherwise participation will not be allowed.
The registration forms can be found on the Quantico Semper Fit Facilities HITT website (click on 2017 HTAC registration link), or at the trainer’s desk at the Barber Physical Activities Center. Completed registration forms can be emailed to HITT Coordinator Charles Yackle at charles.yackle@usmc-mccs.org, or submitted in person at the trainer’s desk.
“We want to send the best Marine-athletes to compete in the championship from Marine Corps Base Quantico,” Yackle said. “Other HITT program coordinators use this competition as a bragging right for the entire year and every installation wants to send the winners to the championship.”
Last year, Staff Sgt. Lauren Schoener, an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona and Cpl. Joshua Boozer from 29 Palms, brought the title back to their installations last year.  Marine Staff Sgt. Amanda Jenks, Marine Corps Forces Cyberspace Command, represented MCBQ last year and placed third, an honor, considering the difficulty of the competition.
In an interview between Marine Corps Community Services and Schoener, the female Marine said she was inspired to push through to the end, especially when she found herself in first place by the end of day two.  
“My secret to success is to be tenacious, consistent and always try anything twice,” said Schoener.
The competition consists of three events meant to push Marines past their breaking point by combining the five unified components of functional based training―movement prep; strength and power; speed, agility and endurance; flexibility and core stability; recovery and mobility.
Marine warrior athletes will take part in the HITT performance combine, a test of athletic prowess comprised of the pro agility drill, 3-cone drill, kneeling med ball throw, standing broad jump, prone 25-yard sprint and the 300-yard shuttle. 
A 400-yard tactical shuttle run and strength challenge will also be included. The 400-yard tactical shuttle run is a test on anaerobic capacity and mettle, consisting of a 50-yard sprint with the Frog training device, 100-yard fireman’s carry with a sandbag, 100-yard run with kettle bells and a 100-yard bear hug run with a sandbag.
The strength challenge consists of a kettle bell dead lift, TRX (utilizing straps) inverted row, and TRX atomic push-up. The objective is to complete as many repetitions as possible in one minute for each movement.
HITT performance combine and the 400-yard tactical shuttle run will be scored by time and the strength challenge will be scored based on repetitions.
According to Yackle, the set-up is very structured, meaning all competitors will move from one event to the next in an orderly fashion and while all events are expected to be completed with maximum effort, Marines are provided ample time for rest―something that is not usually incorporated in CrossFit type workouts or functions.
“I want this competition to bring attention to the benefits the HITT program has on Marines aboard Quantico,” Yackle said. “As a professional strength and conditioning coach, I fully endorse the HITT program as a superior training platform for the active duty Marine and right now not enough Marines are utilizing the program and the professionals running it.”
According to the National Strength and Conditioning Association’s (NSCA) Tactical Strength and Conditioning (TSAC) NSCA-TSAC Department, the HITT program methodology offers a comprehensive and balanced strength and conditioning approach specific for combat readiness and physical resiliency. 
The primary purpose of the HITT program is to enhance operational fitness levels and optimize combat readiness and resiliency for the active duty Marine. 
This comprehensive strength and conditioning program takes into consideration the physical demands of operational related activities in order to optimize physical performance while in combat by implementing the latest cutting edge training methods and fundamental scientific principles. 
HITT  has many advantages including preventing  potential injuries through a well-designed, balanced and progressive prevention program, thus minimizing muscle imbalances, strengthening tendons and ligaments, along with increasing work capacity.
It also increases performance levels that support combat-specific tasks through sound strength and conditioning programs designed around a comprehensive approach, balancing all facets of performance enhancement and exercises that will transfer to the demands of combat. 
The goal is to build strong Marines and further optimize their mobility and speed so these mobilized warriors may deliver more force on demand.

199,In the company of heroes- Pararescue chief retires after 30 years,"“It’s not just retiring a Special Tactics Chief,” said Col. Michael Flatten, vice commander of the 24th Special Operations Wing and the retirement ceremony officiant. “It’s retiring a close friend, a brother in arms, one of my heroes…and one of the best men Special Tactics has ever produced.” 

Keaton’s service began when he enlisted in the Air Force in 1987 as Law Enforcement installation patrol C today’s Security Forces career field. After five years, Keaton realized the job wasn't a good fit for him, despite being credited with saving three lives during that time. 

“I routinely say bloom where you’re planted,” said Flatten. “But sometimes you may be planted in the wrong place, and Keaton was like a Palm tree in Shemya, Alaska.” 

Keaton’s time in Security Forces ended in 1992, when he made the decision to cross train into the Pararescue career field. 

“In law enforcement, there wasn’t a lot of job satisfaction for me; it was a spur of the moment decision to join pararescue because it was the only job available to me at the time,” said Keaton. “I had no idea what I was getting myself into, but I said ‘I’ll do whatever I have to do.’” 

Pararescuemen are among the most highly trained technical rescue and emergency trauma specialists in the U.S. military. They must maintain an Emergency Medical Technician- Paramedic qualification throughout their careers. With this medical and rescue expertise, along with their deployment capabilities, PJs are able to perform life-saving rescue missions in the world's most remote areas. 

After completing the pararescue pipeline, a difficult two-year training process of psychological and physical challenges, his career took a dramatic turn. 

“In every annual report [since he cross trained], Dave’s maturity, drive, professionalism, pursuit of training, selfless service and focus on team are highlighted,” said Flatten. “He continued to save people, on the battlefield and off… including 2 military working dogs.” 

Over the course of his time as a PJ, he attained paramedic, static line and freefall jumpmaster, and dive medical tech qualifications. He trained a generation of new PJs, earning the Outstanding Instructor Award and serving as interim Commandant of Indoctrination Cthe first chapter of the PJ pipeline infamous for its high standards 

“I love pararescue: I loved my career, I loved the men I served with and the ST community as a whole,” said Keaton. “That’s why I stuck around it for so long: it was home for me.” 

Keaton deployed more than 15 times throughout his career in support of Operations FIERY VIGIL, SOUTHERN and NORTHERN WATCH, JOINT ENDEAVOR, ENDURING FREEDOM, IRAQI FREEDOM, COPPER DUNE and NEW DAWN. 

Each deployment served to showcase Keaton’s courage; he was credited numerous times with charging behind enemy lines to rescue fallen teammates and save lives C epitomizing the pararescue creed C “These things we do … that others may live.” 

“He set the standard for service in a selectively-manned unit tasked with the nation’s toughest missions, including a hostage rescue in 2008 and a combat military free fall infiltration in Afghanistan in 2009,” said Flatten. 

Leaders in Special Tactics describe him as an “absolute juggernaut,” “trusted advisor and right hand man,” “the most powerful SNCO I’ve ever supervised,” “proven warrior and leader”….and most importantly to many Special Tactics Airmen, “trusted teammate.” 

He accomplished all that despite challenges he faced, never losing focus on the mission nor his love for those around him. 

“I now know what sacrifice is,” said Keaton of his time in Special Tactics. “I know firsthand what loss is, and what those families go through when they lose loved ones overseas to protect our freedoms.” 

This dedication to the fallen was epitomized when he participated in an  812-mile memorial ruck march from San Antonio, Texas, to Hurlburt Field, Fla. in 2014. It came at a time when the Special Tactics community was reeling from the loss of two operators, Capt. Matthew Roland and Staff Sgt. Forrest Sibley, who were killed in an ambush during a deployment to Afghanistan that year.

Unbeknownst to his teammates, Keaton had broken three ribs a week before the ruck march began, but kept that to himself. Matching Cand sometimes outdoing-- the pace of teammates 20 years his junior the entire trip, he rucked 128 miles with a 50-pound rucksack and a baton engraved with one of the 19 Special Tactics Airmen killed in action. 

“I’m not going to complain about broken ribs -- the pain I felt during the march paled in comparison to what the Roland and Sibley families are going through, so having three ribs is something I can deal with.""

Keaton ran the last 12 miles of the memorial ruck to meet the waiting Gold Star families at the finish line...despite suffering a stress fracture in his leg.

“I’m thankful to serve with incredible people that have made that ultimate sacrifice. Not one day goes by where I don’t think about at least one of those guys,” added Keaton. 

According to Keaton, life after retirement will be spent catching up with friends and making time for the things that are important outside of work. But, the Special Tactics community is now left with big shoes to fill-- someone who will never quit.

201,30 years past- 20th FW role in Victor Alert,"SHAW AIR FORCE BASE, S.C. C Thirty years ago, the first of November marked the end of the decades-long nuclear stalemate between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union.

For 28 years, forces on both sides of the Cold War stood vigilant against threats from the opposition.

During that time, the 20th Fighter Wing, based in England C first at Royal Air Force Wethersfield, and then RAF Upper Heyford C was a part of the mission known as Quick Reaction Alert, more commonly known as Victor Alert. Their job was to provide tactical nuclear weapons at a moment’s notice, providing targeting options in Eastern Europe and deterring Soviet forces from concentrating conventional forces and firepower.

“This was more of a deterrent than anything,” said Christopher Koonce, 20th FW historian. “Just to show them ‘hey, we’re here if you want to start trouble. We can handle it.’”

To retain their mission-ready status, crews remained on alert for 72-hour periods, prepared to take off within 15 minutes of an alert order.

Aircraft remained fully loaded with nuclear weapons, fueled and ready to go, said Koonce. Nearby in the alert facility aircrews slept, ate and remained for their alert shift. If the call ever came to deploy the weapons, all they had to do was run out the door, get on the jet and go.

Even though that call never came, the crews still had to practice to keep their skills sharp. Crews participated in drills where they would scramble as though it were a real-world situation, but before takeoff the nuclear weapons would be removed and returned to storage. Afterward, the pilots would fly as the mission directed.

“The Fulda Gap was the big thing during that time frame,” said Koonce. “All of the exercises, everything had to do with that C the Russians going and taking over Western Germany and moving across Western Europe like a plague.”

According to a March 1987 Los Angeles Times article, a key point of defense against the Soviet threat was the Fulda Gap in West Germany. The gap was pinpointed by NATO planners as a likely invasion route into Western Europe; there the United States maintained nearly 250,000 troops, part of a larger NATO force of about 990,000. These forces were poised to face off against more than 1 million Warsaw Pact personnel.

Though Victor Alert officially ended Nov. 1, 1986, today’s aircraft such as the F-16CM Fighting Falcon and F-15E Strike Eagle still retain the capability to arm nuclear weapons if necessary to combat today’s adversaries.

202,"After 30 Years of Dedication, Escalante retires from the Corps","Colonel Yori R. Escalante, during a ceremony at John A. Lejeune Hall, retired after 30 years of selfless service to the Marine Corps at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, Oct. 14. 

“How does someone define 30 years in the Marine Corps,” said Col. Yori R. Escalante, deputy commander of Marine Corps Installations East-Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. “In my opinion it’s the people, it’s the people that you serve with, it’s the people who have influenced you and molded and shaped you into what you are today.”

Escalante deployed to Aviano, Italy in support of Operation Joint Endeavor, to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and twice to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Maj. Gen. Charles L. Hudson first met Escalante at Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom and enjoyed having him as chief of staff.

“I’ll tell you what, (there’s) no finer chief of staff (that I’ve) ever had than this man right here,” said Hudson. “And I say that because at that particular point in time there were numerous issues that had to be resolved, joyfully resolved at the chief of staff level.” 

Over his career Escalante earned the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with gold star, the Bronze Star, the Meritorious Service Medal with two gold stars, and the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal with gold star. 

Escalante also received the Navy Achievement Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, and NATO Medals for Former Republic of Yugoslavia and the International Security Assistance Force, Afghanistan.

“If I could use one word to describe Col. Yori Escalante I couldn’t come up with a word,” said Hudson. “I came up with several, but I couldn’t come up with any one. I mentioned tenacity and tenaciousness; deeply committed to God; country and Corps; deeply passionate about his profession; and deeply passionate about his family. I mean he spent 30 years of honest and faithful service in many a clime and place.” 

Escalante went to Texas A&M University earning a Bachelor of Science in Building Construction in December 1986 then became a combat engineer in the Marine Corps the next year in 1987. During his career he earned his Master of Arts in Management from Webster University and Master of Science in National Resource Strategy from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces. He is now married with two children and ready for retirement.

“This is just the end of one chapter and the beginning of another, the next chapter I think will be good,” said Hudson.",2016/10/14,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/212465/after-30-years-dedication-escalante-retires-corps,"NC, UNITED STATES",[],[],北卡罗来纳州，美国,经过30年的奉献，埃斯卡兰特从兵团退休,10月14日，在列琼海军陆战队大本营为海军陆战队无私服务30年后，尤里・R・埃斯卡兰特上校在约翰・a・列琼大厅举行的仪式上退休。海军陆战队设施部副指挥官约里・R・埃斯卡兰特上校（Yori R.Escalante）说：“人们如何定义海军陆战队的30年？”。“在我看来，是人民，是与你一起服务的人民，是人民影响了你，塑造了你，塑造了你今天的样子。”Escalante部署到意大利阿维亚诺，支持联合奋进行动，阿富汗支持持久自由行动，两次伊拉克支持伊拉克自由行动。查尔斯・哈德逊少将在伊拉克自由行动期间第一次见到埃斯卡兰特，并很高兴他能担任参谋长。“我告诉你，（我）这里没有比这个人更好的参谋长了，”哈德逊说。“我之所以这么说，是因为在那个特定的时刻，有许多问题需要解决，在参谋长一级，这些问题都得到了愉快的解决。”在他的职业生涯中，埃斯卡兰特获得了国防高级服务奖章、金星功勋勋章、铜星功勋奖章和两颗金星功勋奖章，海军和海军陆战队金星奖章。埃斯卡兰特还获得了海军成就勋章、总统单位奖章以及前南斯拉夫共和国和阿富汗国际安全援助部队的北约奖章。“如果我能用一个词来形容尤里・埃斯卡兰特上校，我想不出一个词来，”哈德森说。“我想出了几个，但我一个也找不到。我提到了坚韧和坚韧；深深地忠于上帝；忠于国家和军队；深深地热爱他的职业；深深地热爱他的家庭。我的意思是，他在许多地方和地方诚实而忠诚地服务了30年。”埃斯卡兰特于1986年12月进入德克萨斯A&M大学获得建筑工程理学学士学位，然后于1987年成为海军陆战队的战斗工程师。在他的职业生涯中，他获得了韦伯斯特大学管理学硕士学位和武装部队工业学院国家资源战略科学硕士学位。哈德森说：“这只是一个章节的结束，另一个章节的开始，我认为下一个章节会很好。”。
203,Charlie 9 BEB Soldiers raise 30-meter mast,"FORT STEWART, Ga. C Soldiers with Charlie Company, 9th Brigade Engineer Battalion, 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division conducted 30-meter mast familiarization and training at Fort Stewart, Georgia, June 27-28.

“Today we are conducting training on how to properly raise and secure the 30-meter masts,” said Sgt. Laurelin Mathis, a multichannel transmission systems operator with C Co.

The 30-meter mast is a large deployable tower capable of elevating two 55-pound antennas to a maximum height of 98 feet. A three-legged base and a series of support cables are used to stabilize the structure in place, according to Army doctrine.

“This training is extremely important for the safety of all Soldiers involved with a mission,” said Sgt. Travis Davis, a multichannel transmission systems operator and noncommissioned officer in charge of the training with C Co. “If Soldiers are not properly trained and something is done incorrectly or not secured properly there is a real potential for it to fall and cause serious injury.”

The signal Soldiers utilize this equipment to adapt to environmental circumstances, such as hills or vegetation, which may interfere with transmission between two communicating high capacity line-of-sight, or HCLOS, shelters.  

""The 30-meter and 15-meter masts are components of the HCLOS shelters,” said Spc. John Smarr, a multichannel transmission systems operator with Co. C. “We use whichever is most efficient to establish connectivity with our distant end.”

Prior to working with the equipment Soldiers participated in classroom training led by subject matter experts.

“A lot of the newer [multichannel transmission systems operators] have little experience with the 30-meter mast,” Davis said. “We are focusing this training on familiarization and explaining basic operation of how to safely set up the 30-meter masts.”

The two-day training was a successful according to Mathis and some of the participants.

“Each of the Soldiers were able to increase their understanding on how the mast is constructed,” Mathis said. “This is training that we will continue to build on so Soldiers are able to increase their proficiencies.”

“This was a great training event. The terrain here at Fort Stewart is relatively flat, so there is little need for such a large mast,” Smarr said. “However, we never know where a mission may take us so training like this is a great way to maintain and improve our skills.”",2016/7/1,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/202979/charlie-9-beb-soldiers-raise-30-meter-mast,"FORT STEWART, GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佐治亚州斯图尔特堡,查理9号BEB士兵举起30米长的桅杆,佐治亚州斯图尔特堡――6月27日至28日，第三步兵师第二步兵旅战斗队第九旅工兵营查理连的士兵在佐治亚州斯图尔特堡进行了30米桅杆熟悉和培训。“今天，我们正在进行如何正确提升和固定30米桅杆的培训。”C公司的多通道传输系统运营商劳雷林・马蒂斯中士说。30米长的桅杆是一个大型可展开塔，能够将两个55磅重的天线提升到98英尺的最大高度。根据陆军条令，一个三条腿的基地和一系列的支撑电缆用于将结构稳定在适当的位置。“这项训练对于所有参与任务的士兵的安全至关重要，”特拉维斯・戴维斯中士说，多通道传输系统操作员和负责C公司培训的士官。“如果士兵没有得到适当的培训，并且某些事情做得不正确或没有得到适当的保护，那么很有可能坠落并造成严重伤害。”信号兵利用该设备适应可能干扰两个通信高容量视线或HCLOS掩体之间传输的环境条件，如丘陵或植被。“30米和15米的桅杆是HCLOS掩体的组成部分，”C公司多通道传输系统运营商Spc.John Smarr说，“我们使用最有效的方法与远端建立连接。”在使用这些设备之前，士兵们参加了由学科专家领导的课堂培训。“许多较新的[多通道传输系统操作员]对30米桅杆几乎没有经验，”戴维斯说。“我们的培训重点是熟悉和解释如何安全安装30米桅杆的基本操作。”马蒂斯和一些参与者表示，为期两天的培训是成功的。“每个士兵都能够提高他们对桅杆构造的了解，”马蒂斯说。斯马尔说：“这是我们将继续加强的训练，以便士兵们能够提高他们的熟练程度。”“这是一次伟大的训练活动。斯图尔特堡的地形相对平坦，因此不需要这么大的桅杆。”。“然而，我们永远不知道任务会把我们带到哪里，所以像这样的训练是保持和提高我们技能的好方法。”

205,"30 Years after Desert Storm, Military Medicine Evolving ‘Phenomenally’","For Dale Smith, a longtime author and a professor of military medicine and history at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, Desert Storm comes down to a single word.

""Survival,"" he said, without hesitation.

Smith, said the ""immediacy of care"" for those wounded in war became a clear priority in the early conflicts of the 20th century, but ""we fundamentally didn't change our system of care from World War II through the Gulf War.""

Medics or corpsmen were decently trained, but they may or may not have had blood on hand for wounded fighters, for example, or penicillin, or morphine.

""That was true in Italy in '44 and it was true as we launched [Operations] Desert Shield and Desert Storm in '91,"" Smith said.

By the Gulf War, he explained, the military's portable, auxiliary, or mobile surgical units were not portable, auxiliary, or mobile.

""We had improved the medicine so much that it would have taken every wheeled vehicle in Saudi Arabia to move a MASH (mobile army surgical hospital),"" Smith said. ""They had portable CT (computerized tomography) scanners that weren't really portable, for taking care of head injuries.""

Coming out of the desert, he said, big changes were in order. Evacuation or fleet hospitals had multiple operating rooms and hundreds of beds and were enormously expensive to move. This lack of medical mobility likely delayed the kickoff of Desert Storm by 30 to 60 days, Smith estimated.

""Casualty projections in the summer of 1990 were astronomical,"" he said. ""Thousands of people on both sides would be wounded or killed. Iraq had the fifth largest military in the world, and this coalition (of nations allied with the United States) was at the end of a mighty long string. So, it was thought it might be a peer-on-peer, even-up fight. Now, it turned out the Iraqi military was big on paper but not big on training, and morale wasn't any good, and they mostly rolled over when confronted.""

Still, some of the lessons learned were staggering. But teasing them out took longer than expected, other experts agreed.

""Since ground combat generated relatively few casualties, especially compared to what was anticipated, there were very few innovations in the practice of medicine as a result,"" said Alan Hawk, manager of historical collections for the National Museum of Health and Medicine at the Defense Health Agency. ""However, the big lesson of the Persian Gulf War was that the medical footprint was way too large and too cumbersome to keep up with a rapidly moving front.""

Because of the clear logistical problems, Smith said that things were undertaken in 1991 that were ""not yet doctrine"" but based on small conflicts from the 1980s, in Grenada and later Panama.

""In both of those [conflicts] we recognized that you could move smaller medical assets quicker,"" he explained.

For instance, Navy SEALs in Panama - just a year before the Gulf War - advanced high-level Special Forces medical care and learned to better stabilize patients. New techniques for transporting and using fluids and antibiotics were developed.

""Then they put [casualties] on an airplane and flew them to San Antonio, with no intermediate hospitals, and they survived,"" Smith said.

In the Gulf, ""we didn't have enough patients get hurt to be statistically significant, but we did recognize that that system was not going to get patients on operating tables quickly,"" Smith said. ""And the surgeons at those operating tables for the most part were not trauma surgeons.""

One Army physician who served in the conflict who can identify with that statement is Dr. Leopoldo ""Lee"" Cancio, a retired colonel now serving as director of the U.S. Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston in Texas. During the Gulf War, Cancio was a young Army captain, attached to the 82nd Airborne Division and only a few years out of medical school.

Smith said a challenge for the military 30 years ago was how to prepare doctors for downrange conditions when they were only accustomed to stateside care facilities. These days, some of the same concerns hold, he said, particularly for Reserve and Guard physicians, nurses, and medics.

""I was used to taking care of injured people, but I was used to doing so in a trauma center setting,"" Cancio said. ""I didn't have much training at all in how to translate that into the field environment.""

Trauma training for military and civilian doctors alike is still ""intermittent,"" Cancio noted.

""So that is a challenge,"" he said. ""What has definitely improved and totally transformed combat casualty care, pre-hospital, has been the concept of tactical combat casualty care.""

Tactical casualty care was an application of the lessons learned based on data collected during the Vietnam War and analyzed with computers in the 1990s, Hawk noted. This resulted in the development of improved hemorrhage control techniques for use by EMTs and combat medics.

In the Gulf, Cancio took a course called Basic Trauma Life Support, which was designed for civilian emergency medical technicians. Other pre-hospital courses and trainings did gain traction eventually, Cancio said.

But it was tactical combat casualty care that ""provided a set of priorities and a sequence of events for people taking care of combat casualties, whether they're under fire, or care en route, which really served as a foundation for everything that we now teach medics and general medical officers, physician assistants, etc., for the pre-hospital environment,"" Cancio said.

But it was tactical combat casualty care that ""provided a set of priorities and a sequence of events for people taking care of combat casualties, whether they're under fire, or care en route, which really served as a foundation for everything that we now teach medics and general medical officers, physician assistants, etc., for the pre-hospital environment,"" Cancio said.

""Knowing what to do when someone is injured and you're being shot at is really important,"" he added.

The combat casualty is different from the average victim of a car wreck in the United States, Cancio said. The severity of something like losing one or both legs to an improvised explosive device is unusual stateside during peacetime.

""One of the important early changes on the battlefield was in how we resuscitate patients, both pre-hospital and upon arrival at a medical unit,"" he said.

To that end, Cancio noted that the availability and portability of blood products and blood transfusions have evolved much in the past 30 years, especially in terms of battlefield care. In addition, much of stateside general surgery these days is minimally invasive and done through scopes, he said. On the battlefield you still must make big incisions on large body parts like the abdomen. That's where additional trauma surgery training becomes vital for military-specific skills.

Likewise, egregious burns are not common peacetime injuries, but are to be expected in combat - something on the order of 5% to 10% of casualties, Cancio said. If you combine burns with a traumatic brain injury, or an amputation, you're talking about truly rare levels of care, and of training for the caretakers.

Coming next week: Part 2, which shows that not all battlefield life-saving measures improved since the Gulf War are highly technical.

206,Sentry Eagle- A look back across 30 years of the exercise,"KLAMATH FALLS, Ore. - Col. Steve “Slick” Harper remembers the first Sentry Eagle which took place in 1986 when he was the base commander. After seeing another guard base do an open house Harper thought it would be a good idea to host one at Kingsley Field.

Simultaneously, one of his fellow instructor pilots pointed out that the Klamath Basin provided every opportunity to host a large number of fighter aircraft because there was enough space and enough people to pull it off.

Harper quotes Capt. Jesse James, one of his instructor pilots, saying, “‘besides that, we’re all getting stale just writing out grade sheets and we want to go fight somebody.’”

Harper agreed to allow the multi aircraft exercise with the stipulation that he be able to open the front gates to the families and the community. Among his reasons, the Air National Guard’s tenure at Kingsley was very young and he felt they needed to make a name for themselves. 

“We were new, just a couple years old and we wanted to build our street cred among the fighter community,” said Harper. “We knew we were good but we needed to show everybody else ― and we did.”

He goes on to temper that just a bit saying, “We just wanted somebody to see our stuff and take it home; we weren’t really showing off on purpose.”

On that week in June, 37 aircraft convened for more than 80 separate sorties to practice Dissimilar Air Combat Training, or put another way to control the airspace in scenarios ranging from bomber sweeps to air interdiction and maybe even a dogfight or two. In those days Sentry Eagle drew a large variety of aircraft: F-106s, F-4s, A-7s, F-16s and F-15s, all of which refueled from a loitering KC-135 tanker. Today units still fly in from around the country but only F-16s, F-15s and the KC-135 are still a part of the line-up. Future plans include fifth generation fighters but it remains to be seen when they will actually participate. 

In any event, the things the inaugural exercise showcased are still true today; every participant would see that the range space is large and convenient to the base, and enjoy some of the 300-plus days of sunshine, also known as good flying weather, the area boasts every year. 

These early years for the ANG at Kingsley catalyzed a piece of culture that endures today. Col. Billy “Rogue” Cox, a former base commander, remembers how the base earned its moniker.

“An early class in the F-4 named us the Land of No Slack,” said Cox. “We were very thorough in our job, if a student had any deficiency or issue on a ride we made real sure they got a chance to do it again.” 

Visiting Airmen could take the name back to their home units and to this day every Kingsley pilot wears the orange “No-Slack” patch on their left arm.

Cox reflects back from those early years when Sentry Eagle was brand new to today where it is a fixture for the base and the community and says what began as an exercise has endeared itself to the local community and become a fixture. 

He goes on to say that as the base’s longevity increases it has added key audiences. This includes a younger generation, some of which have joined the ranks of 173rd Fighter Wing Airmen including Cox’s own son who is currently an instructor pilot at the “Land of No Slack.”  He describes Sentry Eagle as “more of a family-plus-public-plus-the training the aircrews get out of it.”

Initially Kingsley Field hosted Sentry Eagle every year but at some point it became an every-other-year affair. This time around it’s been four years as sequestration cut funding for a 2013 Sentry Eagle. 

One thing that hasn’t changed was best expressed in the lead-up to the very first Sentry Eagle in the local paper June 19, 1986, “Continual training is a requirement, even if it is a lot of fun!” said then Lt. Col. Steven “Slick” Harper.",2015/7/11,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/171040/sentry-eagle-look-back-across-30-years-exercise,"KLAMATH FALLS, OR, UNITED STATES",[],[],克拉马斯瀑布，或称美国,哨兵之鹰――30年演习回顾,克拉马斯福尔斯，俄勒冈州――史蒂夫・哈珀上校“滑头”记得1986年当基地指挥官时第一只哨兵鹰。在看到另一个警卫基地进行开放式训练后，哈珀认为在金斯利球场举办一次是个好主意。同时，哈珀的一位教练飞行员同伴指出，克拉马斯盆地提供了容纳大量战斗机的一切机会，因为那里有足够的空间和足够的人来完成任务。哈珀引用他的教练飞行员之一杰西・詹姆斯上尉的话说，“‘除此之外，我们写成绩表的时候都会感到厌倦，我们想去和别人打架。’”哈珀同意允许进行多机演习，并规定他能够向家庭和社区敞开大门。他的理由之一是，空军国民警卫队在金斯利的任期非常年轻，他认为他们需要成名。“我们是新来的，才几岁，我们想在拳击手社区中建立我们的街头信誉，”哈珀说。“我们知道我们很好，但我们需要向其他人展示――我们做到了。”他接着说，“我们只是想有人看看我们的东西，把它带回家；我们并不是故意炫耀。”在6月的那一周，37架飞机分别进行了80多架次的空战训练，或者以另一种方式控制空域，从轰炸机扫荡到空中拦截，甚至可能进行一两次混战。当时，“哨兵鹰”吸引了各种各样的飞机：F-106、F-4s、a-7、F-16和F-15，所有这些飞机都是从一艘游荡的KC-135加油机上加油的。今天，部队仍然从全国各地飞过来，但只有F-16、F-15和KC-135仍然是阵容中的一部分。未来的计划包括第五代战斗机，但它们何时真正参加还有待观察。无论如何，首场演习展示了一个重要的事实We’今天仍然如此；每个参与者都会看到靶场空间很大，对基地来说很方便，并享受300多天的阳光，也被称为良好的飞行天气，该地区每年都吹嘘。金斯利的ANG的这些早年催生了一种延续至今的文化。比利上校“流氓”考克斯，一位前基地指挥官，记得这个基地是如何赢得这个称号的。考克斯说：“一个早期的F-4班把我们命名为“无懈怠之地”。我们在工作中非常认真，如果一个学生在旅途中有任何缺陷或问题，我们会确保他们有机会再次这样做。”来访的飞行员可以把这个名字带回他们的部队，直到今天，金斯利的每位飞行员都穿着橙色的“不松懈”他们左臂上的补丁。考克斯回忆起早期哨兵鹰是全新的，现在它是基地和社区的固定设备。他说，开始时作为一项运动已经受到当地社区的喜爱，并成为固定设备。他接着说，随着基地寿命的延长，它增加了关键观众is包括年轻一代，其中一些人已经加入了第173战斗机联队飞行员的行列，包括考克斯的亲生儿子，他目前是“无懈怠之地”的指导员飞行员。他将哨兵鹰描述为“更多的是一个家庭加上公众，再加上机组人员从中得到的训练。”最初，金斯利・菲尔德每年都会接待哨兵鹰，但在某种程度上，它变成了每隔一年举办一次的活动。这一次是四年前的事了，因为封存削减了2013年哨兵鹰的资金。有一件事没有改变，那就是1986年6月19日当地报纸上第一只哨兵鹰的诞生，“持续的训练是一项要求，即使它很有趣！”当时的史蒂文中校“斯里克”哈珀说。
207,Kansas ROTC program commissions first officers in nearly 30 years,"WICHITA, Kan. C Wichita State University’s Reserve Officer Training Corps program celebrated its first commissioning ceremony since 1993 on May 14. The two new officers, 2nd Lt. José Garcia and 2nd Lt. Gabriel Schrag, are now members of the Medical Service Corps, Kansas Army National Guard, and the Nurse Corps, Active Duty, respectively. 

After more than 25 years since being disbanded, the WSU ROTC program was reestablished in the fall of 2019 as the result of a collaboration between Dr. Marché Fleming-Randle, vice president of WSU, and the KSARNG. The program’s uniformed cadre and instructors are entirely staffed by the KSARNG, a unique arrangement compared to other ROTC programs, which are usually staffed by Active-Duty Army officers and noncommissioned officers. 

Maj. Eric Hollingsworth, assistant professor of military science, who was brought in by KSARNG leadership to help rebuild the program in 2019, said that since its revival WSU ROTC has been flourishing. The program has nearly 60 students enrolled currently and is looking to grow to 75 or 80 in the fall 2021 semester. 

“At first I didn’t think it was possible that we'd be able to commission two cadets in two years,” Hollingsworth said. “It was just the right time timing of how these things came together. 

“It's been a lot of work, a lot of sleepless nights,” he laughed. 

As the two most senior students in the program, Hollingsworth said Garcia and Schrag has a lot of additional responsibilities juniors and seniors in already-established programs might not have to think about. 

“We sent them to a lot of recruiting events the last couple of years and do a lot of extra stuff in the community,” said Hollingsworth, explaining that WSU ROTC has had to work diligently to get the word out about the return of the program and the opportunities once again available to students looking to pursue a military career while earning a degree from WSU.  

“These guys helped run the program the last two,” Hollingsworth said. “And to see the growth that we've had because of their leadership and support the program continues to see, it's awesome. It's exciting. I’m very proud of them and of all their hard work and effort.”

Keynote speaker for the ceremony, Brig. Gen. John Aarsen, deputy commander, 79th Theater Sustainment Command and WSU alumni, class of 1989, addressed the graduates and the audience. 

“ROTC has been a proud tradition for nearly a hundred years,” Aarsen said. “One of creating agile and adaptive leaders who have led our country and our Army from the battlefields of World War I to the far corners of the world today. You will travel a path that many others have traveled ahead of you; ROTC has commissioned over seven hundred thousand lieutenants. It's a well-worn path, but you get to define where it goes for you.

“It is the strength of our Army is that you are judged by your accomplishments,” Aarsen said. “Your heart and your head - they are what will define you and move your career.”

Garcia hails from Hutchinson and has been a member of the KSARNG for 6 years and was the KSARNG Soldier of the Year in 2014. He earned his degree in communication science and disorders, maintained a GPA of 3.9 and was recognized as a distinguished military graduate, finishing in the top 10 percent of cadets in the 2021 commissioning class nation-wide. He will begin his doctors of audiology program this summer through Wichita State.

Schrag hails from Newton. He earned his degree in nursing, maintaining a GPA of 3.8, and will attend the basic officer leadership course at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio before embarking on his Active-Duty career. 

“I can't begin to say how proud all the leadership at Wichita State is,” Hollingsworth said. “Both of you and of this program and its future success.”",2021/5/18,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/396749/kansas-rotc-program-commissions-first-officers-nearly-30-years,"WICHITA, KS, UNITED STATES",[],[],威奇托，KS，美国,堪萨斯州后备军官训练团计划在近30年中委任了第一批军官,堪萨斯州威奇托威奇托州立大学预备役军官训练团项目于5月14日举行了自1993年以来的首次启用仪式。两名新军官，第二中尉JoséGarcia和第二中尉Gabriel Schrag，现在分别是堪萨斯州陆军国民警卫队医疗服务团和现役护士团的成员。在解散25年多之后，由于WSU副校长马奇・弗莱明・兰德尔博士与KSARNG的合作，WSU ROTC计划于2019年秋天重新建立。该计划的军装干部和教员全部由KSARNG配备，这是一种独特的安排，与其他ROTC计划相比，后者通常由现役军官和士官配备。军事科学助理教授埃里克・霍林斯沃思少校（Maj.Eric Hollingsworth）在2019年被克萨恩领导层请来帮助重建该项目。他说，自该项目恢复以来，WSU后备军官训练团一直蓬勃发展。该项目目前招收了近60名学生，预计在2021年秋季学期将增至75或80名。霍林斯沃思说：“起初，我认为我们不可能在两年内任命两名学员。”。“这正是这些东西结合在一起的正确时机。”这是一项艰巨的工作，许多不眠之夜他笑了。霍林斯沃思说，加西亚和施拉格是该项目中两个最高年级的学生，他们在已经建立的项目中可能不需要考虑很多额外的责任。他说：“过去几年，我们让他们参加了很多招聘活动，在社区中做了很多额外的事情。”霍林斯沃思说，他解释说，WSU后备军官训练团必须努力工作，让外界知道该计划的回归，以及希望在获得WSU学位的同时从事军事生涯的学生再次获得机会。霍林斯沃思说：“在过去两个月里，这些人帮助管理了该计划。”。“看到他们的领导和对项目的支持使我们取得了持续的增长，这太棒了。这太令人兴奋了。我为他们以及他们所有的辛勤工作和努力感到骄傲。”典礼主旨演讲人、第79战区维持司令部副指挥官兼1989届WSU校友约翰・奥尔森准将向毕业生和观众致辞。“ROTC是近百年来引以为傲的传统，”奥尔森说。“他是一位创造敏捷、适应性强的领导者，带领我们的国家和军队从第一次世界大战的战场走向当今世界的遥远角落。你将走一条许多其他人都走在你前面的道路；后备军官训练团已经委任了超过70万名中尉。这是一条老生常谈的道路，但你需要定义它的走向对你来说。“我们军队的力量在于你的成就，”Aarsen说，“你的心和你的头脑――它们将决定你的命运，推动你的事业。”加西亚来自哈钦森，6年来一直是KSARNG的成员，2014年成为KSARNG年度最佳士兵。他获得了通信科学和疾病的学位，GPA保持在3.9，被公认为杰出的军事毕业生，在2021年全国-w委托班学员中名列前10%ide。今年夏天，他将通过威奇托州开始他的听力学博士课程。施拉格来自牛顿。他获得了护理学位，GPA保持在3.8，并将参加圣安东尼奥山姆休斯顿堡的基本军官领导力课程，然后开始他的现役生涯。霍林斯沃思说：“我不能说威奇托州立大学的所有领导层有多自豪。你们和这个项目以及它未来的成功都让我感到自豪。”
208,Morgan’s Men recognize 30 years since start of Gulf War,"The Gulf War officially began 30 years ago. On Aug. 2, 1990, the Iraq Army had taken over Kuwait, and President George H. W. Bush sent troops to Saudi Arabia to support Operation Desert Shield. 

Missions during Desert Shield included defense and preparation operations within Saudi Arabia leading to the culminating combat phase, codenamed Operation Desert Storm, which signified actively pushing the Iraq Army out of Kuwait to protect the surrounding region.

Coalition forces ceased fire on Feb. 28, 1991, thus ending the Gulf War.

The 1st Battalion, 623rd Field Artillery, also known as Morgan’s Men, deployed in December 1990, after pre-mobilization training at Fort Campbell, Ky. They returned in June 1991.

Soldiers in the unit recall their deployment to the Persian Gulf as a successful team effort, with shared goals to accomplish the mission, care for each other, and return home safely.
“I took an absolutely fearless group of Soldiers to war,” said then Capt. Rondal L. Turner, commander of Charlie Battery through the deployment. “The things they accomplished were incredible, and the thing I am most proud of is that I brought every person I left with back home.”

The 1-623d is an artillery battalion and has activated into federal service for the Korean War, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and Operation Enduring Freedom.

“The field artillery’s job is to destroy, neutralize or suppress the enemy by cannon, rocket and missile firers and to integrate all fires into the combined arms operation,” Turner continued.
Turner stayed actively involved and served as chief of staff for the KYNG prior to his retirement at the rank of colonel. His unit’s accomplishment reflects his hard work and dedication to his men and this country.

“I spent my career always trying to make the Guard a better organization, and I lead some of the best Soldiers on Earth during my 29 years in the Guard,” said Turner.
The early 1990s deployment to the Middle East required training and readiness from Soldiers of all ranks. Soldiers from the 1-623d were prepared to take on the difficult mission they faced.

“I feel like there were no problems at all,” said Staff Sgt. Edward Donahue, supply sergeant for Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, 2nd Battalion, 138th Field Artillery. “I feel like it was a good mission, and we completed our tasks with no issues.”

At the time of the deployment, Donahue was a cannon crew member on a M110A2 Self-Propelled Howitzer team assigned to Charlie Battery. The unit promoted him to sergeant shortly after returning home from Desert Storm.

Donahue claims the deployment helped him mature as a Soldier and as a person.

“As a young soldier who hasn’t deployed―or ever been around others who deployed―you are not really paying a lot of attention to training; you are just, kind of, checking the blocks,” said Donahue. “I think once this reality hits you, you will pay attention. That deployment eventually taught me the self-discipline I needed to survive and build myself a long-lasting career.”

The 30 year anniversary of the deployment represents something different for each Soldier who deployed.

“For me, it is a time to remember and honor all who served,” said the retired 1st Sgt. Joseph E. Fair, who deployed with Bravo Battery during the conflict. “Especially, it belongs to those killed in action. It also serves as a reminder of the importance of service to our great nation.”

Fair said that he feels blessed to have been a part of something so important in history.

“As a combat veteran of both Vietnam and the Gulf War, I realize Soldiers train to fight to maintain peace but don’t yearn for war,” said Fair. “Both wars were my booster shot for helping me to realize America is the greatest place in the world and living here is such an honor.”

Revisiting moments of the past allowed these Veterans to reflect on what they learned.

Retired Maj. Gen. Joseph “Lonnie” Culver served as battalion personnel officer during their mobilization. He later served as battalion executive commander once the 1-623d arrived in Saudi Arabia.

“The lessons learned stuck with me,” said Culver. “Each Soldier needs to be technically and tactically proficient in their position, the right person should be selected for the right job, training opportunities should be provided so they know and understand their jobs, and excellence should be demanded in their performance.”
Culver spoke highly of the group of Soldiers he deployed with.

“The 30th anniversary is a time to celebrate the accomplishments of one of the finest groups of men―and some of the best-trained Soldiers―I served with throughout my career,” said Culver.

John Wayne Smith, also a retired colonel and former chief of staff for the KYNG, commanded the battalion as a major. Typically, the battalion command assignment is reserved for a higher rank. However, Maj. Smith’s battalion outperformed the other National Guard combat arms battalions.

209,Three Packs to 30 Miles- Sgt. 1st Class Robert Reeves,"ATLANTA ― Sgt. 1st Class Robert Reeves smoked his first cigarette at age six and didn't put them down until he was 38. By the time he quit, the Alabamian was smoking three packs a day and couldn't walk to his mailbox without getting winded. 

Then a recruiter knocked on his door.

Reeves, the son of a Green Beret, enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1983 and got out after three years. Nearly two decades later, his then-wife called a recruiter after her son entered the Army. Her reasoning, she didn't want her son to join alone.

Reeves thinking the recruiter was coming for his stepson, told him that the young man had already shipped to basic training. He found out that the recruiter was there to talk to him about joining the Army Reserve. 

After 18 years out of uniform, Reeves joined in the winter of 2004. He attended his first battle assembly in Huntsville, Alabama. Per usual, he chain-smoked four cigarettes before entering the gates of the reserve center. 

His new commander watching Reeves light one cigarette after another took note. 

""My battalion commander wanted to get rid of me,"" Reeves said. ""He said, 'I don't want that guy in my unit. That guy is a train!'""

The train's habit led his commander to think he couldn't pass the Army Physical Fitness Test, and he made Reeve's an offer. 

Pass the PT test and get promoted, or fail, and get the boot.

""Right beside the promotion paperwork was a counseling statement to start to kick me out,"" Reeves said. ""The battalion commander gave it to the S1, and the S1 said he would give me a PT test the next day."" 

Early the next morning, Reeves set out to take the APFT. He stepped into 20-degree weather and frost on the ground. ""It was freezing. My lungs were full of tar,"" he said. 

Reeves passed the pushup and situp events with ease but said he was winded and waited the full ten minutes before attempting the run. The test administrator told Reeves, ""It's gonna suck if you have to grind up your promotion paperwork."" 

Determined not to get kicked out, Reeves went full throttle. 

""I had four laps,"" he said. ""I forced my pace and got to where I just couldn't breathe. I got down to the third lap, and I was sweating blood. I had blood coming out of my mouth. It was bad.""

On his final lap, Reeves said he felt himself slipping into darkness. 

""The walls were closing in,"" he said. ""The guy yells, 'He's gonna grind up your promotion!' I got to the finish line, and everything was starting to go, I was going sideways. I fell over the line. The last thing I heard was 'he passed.'""

 Reeves quit smoking Christmas Day 2004.

""I said a little prayer. I can put it down for one day, I'll give it to you for your birthday, and God you gotta take it from there. I never picked them up since,"" he said. 

Fast forward 16 years and Reeves, who turned 54 in May, is running ultramarathons. He's run three 50K races and also a Half Ironman Triathlon under his belt. He was training for a 100-mile race before getting notified for deployment to southwest Asia. 

""This year, I was trying to do a 100 mile run by October, but I'm deploying,"" he said. ""I'm going to continue running while I'm over there. I'm not going to do extreme because of the heat, but as soon as I return, I'm going to pick it back up."" 

Reeves, who is from Gadsden, Alabama, serves as the operations and training NCO with the 335th Signal Command (Theater), Headquarters, and Headquarters Company outside of Atlanta. He joined the Army Reserve's Active Guard Reserve program after losing his civilian retirement during the Great Recession and continues to serve because of the camaraderie and diversity.

""I think diversity is one of the best things I've found in the military. I've met a lot of different people. Some of the best people have not been like me,"" he said. ""People that I trust my life with have not been or looked like me. It may shock you at first, but it gives you more hope about the world in general. It's not just your corner of the world that's going to matter.""",2020/6/17,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/372347/three-packs-30-miles-sgt-1st-class-robert-reeves,"ATLANTA, GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],亚特兰大，佐治亚州，美国,三包30英里-罗伯特・里维斯上士一等舱,亚特兰大――罗伯特・里夫斯上士六岁时抽了第一支烟，直到38岁才放下。当他戒烟时，阿拉巴马人已经每天抽三包烟了，走到邮箱前都会喘不过气来。接着，一名征兵员敲了敲他的门。里维斯是一名绿色贝雷帽的儿子，1983年应征入伍，三年后退伍。将近二十年后，他当时的妻子在儿子参军后给一名征兵员打电话。根据她的推理，她不想让儿子单独加入。里夫斯认为招聘人员是来找他的继子的，告诉他，这个年轻人已经接受了基础训练。他发现征兵员是来跟他谈加入预备役部队的事的。在脱掉制服18年后，里夫斯于2004年冬天加入。他参加了在阿拉巴马州亨茨维尔举行的第一次战斗集会。像往常一样，他在进入预备中心大门前连续抽了四支烟。他的新指挥官看着里夫斯一支接一支地点着烟，注意到了这一点。“我的营长想除掉我，”里夫斯说。“他说，‘我不想那个家伙进入我的部队。那个家伙是火车！’”火车的习惯让他的指挥官认为他不能通过陆军体能测试，于是他向里夫提出了一个条件。里夫斯说：“通过PT考试就可以升职，或者不及格就可以被解雇。升职文件旁边有一份咨询声明，打算把我踢出去。”。“营长把它交给了S1，S1说他第二天会给我一次PT测试。”第二天一早，里夫斯出发去参加APFT。他踩进了20度的天气，地面上结了霜。“天气很冷。我的肺里充满了焦油，”他说。里夫斯轻松地通过了俯卧撑和仰卧起坐项目，但他说，在尝试跑步之前，他已经喘不过气来，等了整整十分钟。测试管理员告诉里夫斯，“如果你必须认真处理你的晋升文件，那就糟透了。”里夫斯决定不被开除，全力以赴。“我跑了四圈，”他说。在最后一圈，里夫斯说他感觉自己滑入了黑暗之中。他说：“墙越来越近了。”。“那家伙喊道，‘他会让你升职的！’我到了终点线，一切都开始走了，我在侧身。我从终点线摔了下来。我最后听到的是‘他通过了’。”里夫斯在2004年圣诞节戒烟。“我做了一个小小的祈祷。我可以把它放下来一天，我会在你生日的时候送给你，上帝啊，你必须从那里拿走它。“从那以后，我就再也没有学过，”他说。快进16年，5月年满54岁的里夫斯正在跑超级马拉松。他参加过3次50公里赛跑，还参加过一次半铁人三项全能。在接到通知部署到西南亚之前，他正在训练100英里赛跑。“今年，我试图在10月之前完成100英里赛跑，“但我正在部署，”他说，“我将在那里继续跑步。”。由于天气炎热，我不打算做极端运动，但我一回来，就要把它捡起来。”里夫斯来自阿拉巴马州的加兹登，是第335信号司令部（战区）的作战和训练士官他在大萧条期间失去了平民退休后加入了陆军预备队的现役警卫预备队计划，并继续服役，因为他的同志情谊和多样性。“我认为多样性是我在军队中发现的最好的东西之一。我见过很多不同的人。“一些最优秀的人并不像我，”他说，“那些我信任我的人并不像我，也不像我。一开始它可能会让你震惊，但它让你对整个世界充满了希望。重要的不仅仅是你的世界一角。”
210,MARADMIN 285/30 details permanent change of station tier system,"While adapting to the current Department of Defense-wide Stop Movement Order in response to COVID-19, the Marine Corps addresses the latest guidance regarding Permanent Change of Station (PCS) in MARADMIN 285/20. This guidance outlines the actions of the HQMC, Manpower Management Division and Reserve Affairs Management that will affect the permanent change of station (PCS) orders for the remainder of 2020.
 
MARADMIN 285/20 explains the tier system that will be followed beginning July 1, 2020. The tier system is a framework that ensures Marines arrive at their specific units to meet prioritized mission requirements. 

“The ‘Tiers’ are a decision support tool for M&RA, and there will be exceptions made on individual Marine cases,” states the order.

""As stop move comes to an end, the Marine Corps will execute PCS moves in a phased approach by tier as indicated in the MarAdmin,"" said MGySgt Bryant Lodge, career planner for I Marine Expeditionary Force. ""As orders are issued Marines must take the necessary steps to execute orders.  This includes checking MOL for orders/modifications, contacting DMO, and enlisted Marines ensuring they have the required obligated service to execute orders.""

Tier 1 is scheduled for July-August 2020 and will focus on PCS moves that contribute to force generation actions. For example, aboard Camp Pendleton, this will include Marines inbound as instructors to Staff Noncommissioned Officer Academy.

Tier 2 is scheduled for August-September 2020 and focuses on orders that contribute to institutional priorities, which includes but is not limited to those Marines that are inbound to and from an accompanied overseas assignment. 

As for Tier 3, which is scheduled for September-November 2020, Marines whose moves will contribute to readiness generation will be eligible.

“The Service retains operational capability while prioritizing PCS moves between July-November 2020 to accommodate the expected insufficient transportation industry capacity.”

Manpower Management will maximize the use of Permanent Change of Assignment (PCA) and Low-Cost Permanent Change of Station (LCPCS) orders to mitigate the expected shortfalls in the United States Transportation Command/ Distribution Management Office.  PCA and LCPCS orders are exempt from the tier system and will be executed with in the timeline directed on their orders. 

Before June 30, 2020, a movement request can be completed with an Exception to Policy (ETP.) This can be granted for orders that are determined as mission essential, necessary for humanitarian reasons, or warranted due to extreme hardship. Marines granted an ETP may not take leave in conjunction with their PCS if their order coincides with the Stop Move.

As the Marine Corps continues to adapt its policies in response to COVID-19, MARADMINS will be a vital source of information for Marine Corps-wide updates.

211,The ACV Through an AAV Crewman’s Eyes,"MARINE CORPS AIR GROUND COMBAT CENTER TWENTYNINE PALMS, Calif. (April 5, 2021) -- “Being an ACV crewman is at the root of what the Marine Corps is,” Lance Cpl. Gaven Sack said. “It encompasses a lot of things, on land and in the water.”
Sack, an Assault Amphibious Vehicle (AAV) crewmember with Co. D, 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion, 1st Marine Division, is part of the only military unit that has tested and fielded the new Amphibious Combat Vehicle (ACV) to date.
The ACV is an eight-wheel drive, armored vehicle with open-ocean amphibious capabilities and land mobility. It’s a unique combination of previously fielded amphibious vehicles and new technological advances to the fleet’s amphibious capabilities.
For Sack, the desire to operate the ACV began before he joined the Marine Corps. “I worked in concrete before I joined and I talked to one of the truck drivers at a job site I was on, who was formerly a Marine. I told him I was working on joining and he told me he was an 1833 tracker [AAV crewmember].” After that conversation, Sack said being a tracker interested him. AAV crewmen are nicknamed ‘trackers’ due to the first iterations of these vehicles, developed around 1935, having tracks instead of the wheels they have today.
“I’m from Grand Rapids, Minnesota, born and raised,” he said. “You know, as a kid I played army and always dreamed of being in the military … I never thought I would get to be a part of something this big.”
Marines with Co. D were the first to get their hands on a prototype of this vehicle. The senior members of this unit were able to use the knowledge they gained from years of operating AAVs to provide feedback so the ACVs could better fit the needs of the Marine Corps.
While he was in training for his job, Sack got to see the ACVs as they were in the testing phase. According to Sack, he learned how to be an effective crew member in an AAV and did not get to experience the ACV until November 2020, when he was trained by other Marines in Co. D on how to operate the vehicles properly.
“The last few exercises I have done with these vehicles have really proven to me how effective they really are,” Sack explained. “They’re lethal, they’re fast, they’re armored, they’re easily camouflaged and they are just, all around, a great vehicle.”
The vehicle itself has aided in the interaction between the crewmembers and the Marines they transport, Sack said. 
“Honestly, I think these benefit not only the track crews that operate them, but also all the Marines we transport by providing comfort, security and a lot of armor,” he expressed while he relaxed in one of the rear seats of the ACV. “I haven’t had a single unit of Marines get on and off this vehicle with any complaints. I think that so far, from what I have seen, the infantry units have done a great job of learning the vehicle, its capabilities and employing the vehicles to best support them.”
“I am excited to see these vehicles get fielded throughout the rest of the Marine Corps. I think it will benefit the Marine Corps overall in a big way,” Sack said.",2021/4/5,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/393987/acv-through-aav-crewmans-eyes,"MARINE CORPS AIR GROUND COMBAT CENTERTWENTYNINE PALMS, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州二十九棕榈岛海军陆战队空地作战中心,通过AAV机组人员的眼睛检查ACV,海军陆战队空地作战中心加利福尼亚州二十九棕榈岛（2021年4月5日）――“作为一名ACV机组人员是海军陆战队的根本，”兰斯・加文・萨克下士说。“它包括很多东西，在陆地上和水中。”萨克是海军陆战队第一师第三突击两栖营的一名突击两栖车（AAV）乘员，是迄今为止唯一一支测试和部署新型两栖战车（ACV）的军事部队的一员。ACV是一种八轮驱动，具有远洋两栖能力和陆地机动能力的装甲车辆。这是以前部署的两栖车辆和舰队两栖能力的新技术进步的独特结合。对于萨克来说，在他加入海军陆战队之前，就开始渴望操作ACV。“在我加入之前，我在混凝土行业工作，我和我所在工作现场的一名卡车司机交谈，他以前是一名海军陆战队。我告诉他我正在加入，他告诉我他是1833年的追踪者[AAV机组成员]。”在那次谈话之后，萨克说，作为一名追踪者，他很感兴趣。AAV机组人员被昵称为“追踪器”，这是因为这些车辆在1935年左右开发的第一代，使用的是履带而不是现在的车轮。“我来自明尼苏达州的大急流城，出生和长大，”他说。“你知道，当我还是个孩子的时候，我就在军队里打球，一直梦想着在军队里……我从没想过我会成为这么大事业的一部分。”Co.D公司的海军陆战队是第一个得到这辆车原型的人。该部队的高级成员能够利用他们从多年操作AAV中获得的知识提供反馈，从而使ACV能够更好地满足海军陆战队的需要。当Sack正在为工作进行培训时，Sack看到了处于测试阶段的ACV。据萨克说，他学会了如何在AAV上成为一名高效的乘员，直到2020年11月，他才体验到ACV，当时他在Co.D接受了其他海军陆战队关于如何正确操作车辆的培训。“我对这些车辆所做的最后几次练习向我证明了它们是多么有效。”萨克解释道。萨克说：“它们是致命的，速度快，有装甲，很容易伪装，而且到处都是一辆很棒的车。”这辆车本身有助于他们运送的船员和海军陆战队之间的互动。“老实说，我认为这些不仅有利于操作它们的轨道工作人员，也有利于我们运输的所有陆战队员，因为它们提供了舒适、安全和大量的装甲，”他在ACV的一个后座上放松时表示。“我没有任何一支海军陆战队士兵带着任何抱怨上下这辆车。我认为，到目前为止，从我所看到的情况来看，步兵部队在学习这辆车、它的能力以及使用这些车来最好地支持他们方面做了大量工作。”萨克说：“我很高兴看到这些车辆在海军陆战队的其他部队中得到部署。我认为这将对海军陆战队整体带来巨大的好处。”。
212,Marines test new ACV’s ability to integrate with naval shipping,"U.S. Marines with Amphibious Vehicle Test Branch, Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity, with the assistance from the amphibious transport dock ship USS Somerset (LPD 25), tested the Marine Corps’ new Amphibious Combat Vehicle off the shore of Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, Jan. 27-28.

The testing was the first time Marines have taken the ACV on and off of a naval vessel through the well deck, assessing and verifying the vehicle’s ability to integrate with naval shipping.  

 “AVTB has been conducting testing with the ACV for approximately three years,” said U.S. Marine Maj. Justin Davis, the deputy director of AVTB. “As we look to replace the legacy platform (Amphibious Assault Vehicle), it goes without saying the ACV needs to do exactly what the AAV does.” 

The multi-day test consisted of embarking and debarking the naval vessel and multiple on-ship operations. The Marines conducted the embarking and debarking operations while the ship was moving at various speeds and with the ACV’s configured at different weights. While inside the ship, the Marines tested the ACV’s towing, pushing and pulling capabilities. 

“It's good to see these changes happening within the amphibious community,” said  Sgt. Nicholas Vickers, a vehicle commander with AVTB. “We are setting the standard operating procedures for these vehicles so when they hit the Fleet Marine Force, there is a smooth transition.”

The ACV has proven in its testing to bring enhanced lethality, survivability and maneuverability compared to the AAV. The AVTB’s role in testing the ACVs in their developmental stage is essential to pass on to the operating forces for when it is fielded. Performing successful ship to shore operations takes the ACV one step closer to securing a spot in Marine Corps history.",2020/1/31,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/361409/marines-test-new-acvs-ability-integrate-with-naval-shipping,"CAMP PENDLETON, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州彭德尔顿营地,海军陆战队测试新型ACV与海军舰船集成的能力,美国海军陆战队两栖车辆测试分队，海军陆战队战术系统支持活动部，在两栖运输码头舰USS Somerset（LPD 25）的协助下，在加利福尼亚州海军陆战队彭德尔顿大本营海岸外测试了海军陆战队的新型两栖作战车辆，1月27日至28日。该测试是海军陆战队首次通过钻井甲板将ACV从海军舰艇上取下，评估和验证该车辆与海军舰船集成的能力。AVTB副主任、美国海军陆战队少校贾斯汀・戴维斯（Justin Davis）说：“AVTB已经用ACV进行了大约三年的测试。“在我们寻求更换传统平台（两栖攻击车）时，不用说ACV需要做AAV所做的事情。”多日测试包括登上和卸下军舰以及多个船上操作。海军陆战队在船舶以不同速度移动时进行登船和卸货操作，ACV配置为不同重量。在船内，海军陆战队测试了ACV的牵引、推拉能力。AVTB的车辆指挥官尼古拉斯・维克斯中士说：“很高兴看到这些变化在两栖动物社区内发生。”。“我们正在为这些车辆制定标准操作程序，以便当它们撞上舰队海军时，平稳过渡。”ACV在其测试中证明，与AAV相比，其杀伤力、生存能力和机动性都得到了增强。AVTB在ACV开发阶段测试中的作用对于将其部署到作战部队至关重要。执行成功的船对岸作战使ACV距离确保海军陆战队历史上的地位又近了一步。
213,Marine Corps Systems Command awards contract to produce ACV,"Marine Corps Systems Command awarded a contract to produce Amphibious Combat Vehicles―a much-needed modernization to the Marine Corps’ ground combat element.

Following a successful Milestone C decision by the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition, the contract options worth $198 million will allow BAE Systems to build 30 low rate production vehicles, which will start delivering in the fall of next year. These vehicles will begin the transition of a portion of the Assault Amphibious Vehicle fleet.

The Assault Amphibious Vehicle has been in service for more than 40 years, and many of its components and parts are obsolete and no longer manufactured. Because of this, the vehicles are becoming increasingly costly and difficult to maintain. That, and the changing environment in which Marines find themselves plagued by the improvised explosive device threat, has produced a need for a new, more survivable combat vehicle that can maneuver from ship to shore and beyond.  

“In order to be a step ahead of our adversaries in the future, the Marine Corps needed to find a modern vehicle at an affordable price range that provided significant capability enhancement and performance over the AAV,” said Col. Kirk Mullins, ACV 1.1 product manager in Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault in the Program Executive Officer Land Systems.

The ACV is an eight-wheeled vehicle that will provide protection akin to the Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, with landward maneuverability and mobility that is superior to that of the AAV. It will be outfitted with a precision weapons station for enhanced lethality, and a robust swim capability, allowing it to operate within the littorals and beyond.

“The ACV provides a mobile capability that mechanizes the force to maintain tempo with the remainder of the [Marine Air-Ground Task Force]; specifically the M1A1 tank,” said Mullins. “It isn’t maintenance intensive because of its increased reliability, and it also provides greater protection against threats we encounter on the battlefield.”

The vehicle underwent substantial testing over the past two years to determine how it will protect Marines, be easier to maintain, and meet requirements for survivability and reliability. Testing took place at the U.S. Army Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland; the Amphibious Vehicle Test Branch aboard Camp Pendleton, California; the Yuma Test Center in Arizona; the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center in Mississippi; and the White Sands Missile Range Army Base in New Mexico.

Additionally, the ACV was evaluated aboard the USS Somerset and the USS Anchorage to demonstrate its ability to launch from and recover to amphibious ships, and overall shipboard compatibility.

“Our test program was exhaustive in an effort to ensure we gathered all the data needed to make the best decision,” said Mullins. “We tested the ACV for survivability, mobility, water operations and reliability, and completed gunnery testing.”

Marines who participated in the operational assessment evaluated the vehicle favorably, Mullins said. Those who had previous experience with the AAV were enthusiastic and optimistic about operating the ACV in the future.

216,"The Corps’ new Amphibious Combat Vehicle offers ‘significantly greater survivability, mobility’ than predecessor","The Marine Corps’ Amphibious Combat Vehicle program reached another milestone, proving the vehicle’s ability to deliver future combat power from ship to shore and follow-on objectives. Program Executive Officer Land Systems recently completed testing on the ACV, which proved the new vehicles' ability to not only take on challenging surf, but also complete a long swim from ship to shore and back.  

These major accomplishments facilitated the program moving from what was originally envisioned as an incremental approach, to one that will be known as the ACV family of vehicles, without the nomenclature of ACV 1.1 or ACV 1.2.
In June 2018, Marine Corps Systems Command awarded BAE Systems a contract to begin low rate initial production of the amphibious vehicles. Since then, the Advanced Amphibious Assault program office at Program Executive Officer Land Systems has continued conducting a variety of robust swimming and other tests on the platform.

Most recently, the ACV program office successfully completed 1.2 anticipated requirement testing, and determined the ACV technologically capable of fully replacing the legacy AAV.

‘Significantly greater survivability’

“We’ve landed on a vehicle that is very comparable in the ocean or in the water to the current AAV, with respect to performance,” said Col. Kirk Mullins, program manager for Advanced Amphibious Assault at PEO Land Systems. “We have a vehicle that has significantly greater survivability and mobility than the current platform, and one that―through demonstrated operational tests―the Marines are very happy with.”

Several capabilities were evaluated during recent testing, including the vehicle’s ability to embark and deploy off of an amphibious ship, its ship-to-shore threshold and a high-surf test, which subjected the vehicle to aggressive surf zones with waves reaching over six feet, said Mullins.

“The program office tested the vehicle to all of the ACV 1.2 transition requirements, and even subjected the vehicle to 9-foot waves without issues,” he said. “Because of this, the Marine Corps now was the opportunity to combine the program into a singular ACV family of vehicles program.”

The platform met the 1.2 requirements earlier than anticipated, which the program office credits in part to the competitive process by which the vehicle was selected.

Competition drives innovation

“The success the program has achieved today has a lot to do with how the program was structured and how it’s been executed,” said Angelo Scarlato, ACV 1.1 product manager at PEO Land Systems. “The competition [between industry to produce the ACV] worked, from getting increased performance out of our industry partners and the vehicle at a reasonable price.”

Scarlato also noted with the ACV 1.1 meeting the 1.2 requirements ahead of schedule, the Corps is able to completely avoid the incremental engineering, manufacturing and developmental costs associated with developing a different ACV 1.2 vehicle.

With the completion of 1.2 transition requirement testing, the program office is shifting their focus to operational effectiveness and suitability, force protection and survivability, and logistical sustainability testing, said Scarlato.

“The two statutory tests we have to undergo are [Initial Operational Test and Evaluation] and [Full-Up System Level] live-fire testing,” he said. “For IOT&E, we’re looking at operational effectiveness and operational suitability of the platform. For FUSL, we’re looking at force protection and survivability.”

The ACV is intended to serve Marines for at least the next 20-plus years. With that in mind, Scarlato said the ACV would also undergo logistics demonstration testing.

“For this, we’re focusing more on the suitability and sustainment aspects of the platform,” he said. “We’re not just looking at how effective it is in a combat environment, but also how logistically supportable the platform is.”

Putting the Warfighter first

In an unconventional move by the program office, Marine operators who tested the vehicle were given the opportunity to interface directly with the platform’s program managers and engineers―from both the AAA program office and BAE Systems―in order to provide constructive feedback on improving the vehicle’s design.

“There are some things that you just can’t capture from test reports and surveys that Marines usually fill out after these operational assessments,” said Mullins. “I wanted Marines to have a chance to physically put the ACV engineers and project officers on the vehicle to point out their suggestions for improvements, so when the engineers go back to their offices to design the fixes, they’d have a first-hand experience of what the Marines experienced.”

Mullins credits the project team and vehicle manufacturer for taking robust efforts to incorporate some of the Marines’ suggested changes, many of which will be included in the first release of ACVs later on this year. So far, the team has incorporated seven of the top feedback items provided by Marines. However, Mullins also wants Marines to know their additional feedback and suggestions could still be addressed in later builds of the ACV.

Aiming for continuous improvement by soliciting feedback is something the program office plans to carry into the future.

“We imagine doing something very similar with IOT&E, too,” said Scarlato. “It’s a continuous loop, soliciting feedback from your customer and designing changes to meet the customer’s needs.”",2019/1/28,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/308537/corps-new-amphibious-combat-vehicle-offers-significantly-greater-survivability-mobility-than-predecessor,"MARINE CORPS BASE QUANTICO, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州匡蒂科海军陆战队基地,美国陆军工程兵团的新型两栖作战车辆提供了比前一代“更大的生存能力和机动性”,海军陆战队的两栖作战车辆项目又达到了一个里程碑，证明了该车辆能够将未来的作战能力从船送到岸上，并实现后续目标。项目执行官陆地系统公司最近完成了对ACV的测试，这证明了新型车辆不仅具有挑战性冲浪的能力，而且能够完成从船到岸和从船到岸的长距离游泳。这些重大成就促进了该计划从最初设想的渐进式方法转变为将被称为ACV系列车辆的方法，并于2018年6月取消了ACV 1.1或ACV 1.2的命名，海军陆战队系统司令部授予BAE系统公司一份合同，开始低比例生产两栖车辆。从那时起，项目执行官陆地系统部的高级两栖攻击项目办公室继续在平台上进行各种强劲的游泳和其他测试。最近，ACV项目办公室成功完成了1.2预期需求测试，并确定ACV在技术上能够完全取代传统AAV。“显著提高生存能力”。柯克・马林斯上校说：“我们在海洋或水中降落的车辆在性能上与现有AAV相当。”，PEO陆地系统高级两栖攻击项目经理。“我们拥有一种比现有平台具有更大生存能力和机动性的车辆，并且通过演示的作战测试，海军陆战队非常满意。”在最近的测试中评估了几种能力，包括该车辆在两栖舰艇上登船和部署的能力，Mullins说，该公司的船到岸临界值和高海浪试验使车辆处于海浪超过6英尺的侵蚀性海浪区。项目办公室对车辆进行了所有ACV 1.2过渡要求的测试，甚至对车辆进行了9英尺海浪的测试，没有任何问题。“正因为如此，海军陆战队现在有机会将该计划合并为单一的ACV系列车辆计划。”该平台比预期更早地满足了1.2要求，这部分归功于车辆选择的竞争过程。竞争推动创新PEO Land Systems ACV 1.1产品经理安吉洛・斯卡拉托（Angelo Scarlato）说：“该计划今天取得的成功与该计划的结构和执行方式有很大关系，[行业之间的ACV生产竞争]以合理的价格从我们的行业合作伙伴和车辆中获得更高的性能。”斯卡拉托还指出，随着ACV 1.1提前满足1.2要求，美国陆军工程兵团能够完全避免与开发不同ACV 1.2车辆相关的工程、制造和开发成本增加。随着1.2过渡要求测试的完成，项目办公室正在将重点转移到斯卡拉托说：“作战效能和适用性、部队保护和生存能力以及后勤可持续性测试。我们必须进行的两项法定测试是[初始作战测试和评估]和[全系统级]实弹测试。”。“对于物联网与评估，我们关注的是平台的作战效能和作战适用性。对于FUSL，我们关注的是部队保护和生存能力。”ACV打算在未来20多年内为海军陆战队服务。考虑到这一点，斯卡拉托说，ACV还将进行后勤演示测试。“为此，我们更关注平台的适用性和持续性方面，”他说。“我们不仅关注平台在作战环境中的有效性，还关注平台的后勤保障能力。”在项目办公室的非常规行动中，将作战人员放在首位，测试车辆的海军陆战队操作员有机会直接与平台的项目经理和来自AAA项目办公室和BAE系统的工程师联系，以便就改进车辆设计提供建设性反馈“有些东西是海军陆战队在作战评估后通常填写的测试报告和调查中无法捕捉到的，”马林斯说。“我希望海军陆战队有机会亲自将ACV工程师和项目官员放在车辆上，提出他们的改进建议，这样，当工程师回到办公室设计修复方案时，他们就能亲身体验海军陆战队的经验。”Mullins赞扬项目团队和车辆制造商做出了巨大努力，将海军陆战队的一些建议变更纳入其中，其中许多将在今年晚些时候发布的ACV中包含。到目前为止，该团队已经纳入了海军陆战队提供的七个顶级反馈项。然而，Mullins也希望海军陆战队能够他们的额外反馈和建议仍然可以在以后的ACV构建中解决。通过征求反馈来实现持续改进是项目办公室计划在未来开展的工作。“我们设想在物联网与设备方面也做类似的事情，”斯卡拉托说。“这是一个持续的循环，征求客户的反馈，并设计更改以满足客户的需求。”
217,P-38G Lightning under restoration,"For almost a year, the P-38G Lightning was noticeably missing from the Heritage Park. Over time, people wondered where it went and when it would reappear in its rightful place.

The P-38 is currently being restored and repainted with the help of Airmen from the Aircraft Structural Maintenance unit assigned to the 3rd Maintenance Squadron. The ASM Airmen preserve the structure of aircraft, paint, and fabricate sheet metals and tubing to replace worn or damaged parts, for all active and static-display aircraft. 

“The restoration program is to fully refurbish the aircraft close to its original design,” said Air Force Master Sgt. Sarah Jornacion, 3rd MXS nondestructive inspection section chief. “It is not just a display, but preserving the heritage of the aircraft, and that’s what we do as maintainers. We take pride in bringing it back to its glory.”

To get to where they currently are, there were a lot of steps to restoring the P-38. These steps included moving and towing it inside a hangar. They also took multiple high-definition images, extensive notes, and measurements of the decals, and put the information into a computer. 

Once the data was in the system, a team of four Airmen spent three eight-hour shifts to sand, wash and remove residue from the aircraft. Before applying primer and paint, the Airmen methodically applied protection to surfaces not being painted. 

“It’s been a complicated process,” said Tech. Sgt. Matt Monnens, 3rd MXS aircraft structural maintenance chief lead. “The Air Force switched over to flat paint to all active aircraft, [but] most of the historical aircraft are high-gloss paint. When gloss paint is applied, attention to detail is key, because any flaws underneath can be easily seen.”

Monnens added little details are significant because veterans who had worked on or flown the Lightning would notice a slight change to the aircraft, so it was imperative for the Airmen to make sure to make it look realistic as possible. 

“The paint scheme is a lot harder than it looks because of its two-tone color pattern,” said Tech. Sgt. Renee Peaper, 3rd MXS aircraft structural maintenance craftsman. “It has been a struggle for us to replicate the original paint scheme. Even our most talented painters have had difficulty because of all the obstacles we were running into [such as finding the right color-scheme].”

Master Sgt. Richard Mabry, 3rd MXS aircraft structural maintenance section chief, said more than 30 individuals contributed to the restoration of the aircraft. 

Senior Airman Kurtis Steinecke and Airman 1st Class Jonathan Torres-Zayas, both assigned to ASM, are putting the final details on the aircraft before it returns to its original home. 

“This is a big team effort,” Mabry said. “Through ups and downs such as low manning, work constraints at the flight line and the challenging paint job, the Airmen continued to focus and work together as a team.”

Steinecke had the opportunity to show the aircraft to a family member who happened to trace it to their father who had flown the P-38 during World War II. 

“The family member was visiting Alaska and wanted to visit the Heritage Park because the family member’s father flew the aircraft that was on display,” Mabry said. “They had a brother who had their father’s flight log and traced it back to JBER, and the tail number happened to match the [one here].”

Regardless of the unfinished aircraft, the ASM granted the family’s request to see the aircraft and pay tribute to their dad. 

Steinecke and Torres-Zaya said it’s also important for them to finish this project because they are putting a stamp on the only G model in existence; the JBER plane is one of fewer than 30 P-38s remaining in the world. It is also one of only nine aircraft listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 

“It gives us the chance to be part of the bigger picture that everybody sees and not just the maintenance,” said Steinecke. “It’s not only us; it was a big team effort to get to this point close to the finish line.”

Steinecke and Torres-Zayas shared the same sentiments that when it comes to this aircraft, there is no room for error and that perfection is the key.",2017/7/25,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/242476/p-38g-lightning-under-restoration,"JBER, AK, UNITED STATES",[],[],杰伯，AK，美国,恢复中的P-38G闪电,在将近一年的时间里，遗产公园的P-38G闪电明显失踪。随着时间的推移，人们想知道它去了哪里，什么时候会重新出现在正确的位置上。P-38目前正在第三维修中队飞机结构维修队飞行员的帮助下进行修复和重新喷漆。ASM飞行员保护飞机结构，为所有主动和静态显示飞机喷涂和制造金属板和管道，以更换磨损或损坏的零件。“修复计划是完全翻新飞机接近其原始设计，”空军少校Sarah Jornacion中士说，第三MXS无损检测科科长。“这不仅仅是一次展示，而是保存了飞机的传统，这也是我们作为维修人员所做的。我们为它重回辉煌而感到自豪。”为了达到目前的水平，我们采取了很多步骤来修复P-38。这些步骤包括在机库内移动和拖曳飞机。他们还拍摄了多张高清图像、大量笔记和对贴花的测量，并将信息输入计算机。一旦数据进入系统，一个由四名飞行员组成的小组花了三个八小时轮班对飞机进行打磨、清洗和清除残留物。在涂底漆和油漆之前，飞行员系统地对未涂油漆的表面进行保护。“这是一个复杂的过程，”第三代MXS飞机结构维修首席负责人、技术中士马特・蒙尼斯（Matt Monnens）说。“空军将所有现役飞机改用平漆，[但]大多数历史上的飞机都是高光泽油漆。当使用光泽油漆时，注意细节是关键，因为下面的任何缺陷都很容易看到。”Monnens补充说，小细节是重要的，因为曾经在闪电上工作或飞行过的老兵会注意到飞机的细微变化，因此飞行员必须确保飞机看起来尽可能逼真。第三代MXS飞机结构维修技师技术中士Renee Peaper说：“油漆方案比看起来难多了，因为它有两种色调的颜色图案。”。“我们一直在努力复制原始的油漆方案。即使是我们最有才华的油漆师也遇到了困难，因为我们遇到了所有的障碍[例如找到正确的颜色方案]。”MXS飞机结构维修三科科长理查德・马布里上士，他说，30多人参与了飞机的修复工作。高级飞行员Kurtis Steinecke和一等飞行员Jonathan Torres Zayas都被分配到ASM，他们正在飞机返回其原来的家之前，对飞机的最终细节进行说明。“这是一个巨大的团队努力，”马布里说。“经历了人员配备不足、飞行线的工作限制和艰巨的喷漆工作等起起落落，飞行员们继续集中精力，作为一个团队一起工作。”斯泰内克有机会将飞机展示给一位家庭成员，这位家庭成员碰巧找到了他们在二战期间驾驶P-38飞机的父亲。马布里说：“这名家庭成员当时正在阿拉斯加，想参观遗产公园，因为这名家庭成员的父亲驾驶了展出的飞机。”。“他们有一个兄弟，他有父亲的飞行日志，可以追溯到JBER，尾号恰好与[这里的一个]匹配。”不管这架未完工的飞机，ASM同意了家人的要求，让他们看看飞机并向父亲致敬。Steinecke和Torres Zaya说，完成这个项目对他们来说也很重要，因为他们正在给现存唯一的G模型打上印记；JBER飞机是世界上仅存的不到30架P-38飞机之一。它也是国家历史遗迹登记册上仅有的九架飞机之一。施泰内克说：“这让我们有机会成为每个人都能看到的大局的一部分，而不仅仅是维修。”。“这不仅仅是我们；这是一个大团队的努力，以达到这一点接近终点线。”斯坦内克和托雷斯・扎亚斯都有同样的想法，当谈到这架飞机时，没有错误的余地，完美是关键。

Region also supported health care delivery while developing organizations, leaders and Soldiers working toward a mission to provide medically ready forces and ready medical forces with a vision of being the premier health force, best-trained and equipped to support the nation’s call.

With over 229,000 beneficiaries, the Region is a hub for health care services including outpatient clinic visits, laboratory procedures, pharmacy prescription fills, immunizations, inpatient care and radiology procedures. Dental procedures, veterinary services and ensuring the health readiness of our deploying personnel round out the Region’s everyday functions.

Over the summer, RHC-P saw two major changes in leadership. Brig. Gen. Dennis P. LeMaster took command of RHC-P, while Command Sergeant Maj. Clark J. Charpentier assumed responsibility as the senior enlisted advisor. RHC-P also welcomed a new Deputy Commanding General, Brig. Gen. Michael L. Place.

The RHC-P command also repositioned its headquarters location from Hawaii to JBLM, continuing the support of responsive medical capabilities to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, U.S. Army Pacific and I Corps.

READINESS 

During 2018, RHC-P’s forces remained healthy and prepared to meet any challenge.

Competitions such as the Pacific Regional Trials, Pacific Best Medic and Pacific Best Warrior Competition further the Region’s success by challenging Soldiers during military drills or sporting events. These competitions not only strengthen physical strength, but also build mental resolve.

The Pacific Regional Trials saw about 100 wounded, ill and injured Soldiers and Veterans compete in a multi-sporting event representing 12 Warrior Transition Battalions from across the Pacific, Atlantic, and Central regions. The Pacific Best Medic Competition saw competitors from Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Japan and Korea compete in both physical and mental exercises needed to succeed as a medic on the battlefield. 

Although competitions coupled with training are key components contributing to a ready state, global health engagements were also key to Region’s readiness posture.

Over the past three years the Region has deployed on over 170 missions, and in 2018, efforts continued to provide these critical missions to further enhance health care outcomes in the Indo-Pacific region.  

GHE highlights include the opening of a Cambodia blood donor center in partnership with RHC-P’s military treatment facilities and units, Indo-Pacific and USARPAC. The Cambodia mission marked the grand opening of two blood donor centers, paving the way for the next step, accreditation. Additionally, a nine-person team from RHC-P, Madigan Army Medical Center and the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, to conduct a second clinical laboratory and bio-preparedness subject matter expert exchange. 

These missions exemplify how the Region’s GHEs provide the opportunity to strengthen relationships with partner nations and other key stakeholders.

HEALTH CARE DELIVERY

The Region’s efforts to optimize the health of our beneficiaries by focusing on access, prevention, wellness and health care delivery was another priority in 2018.

Every year, MTFs within the Pacific region reach out to beneficiaries to educate about the importance of receiving relevant and timely care. Access to care is also at the forefront of our patient care. For example, this year, flu shot clinics were again held across the Region, with LeMaster leading the charge, receiving his vaccination at one of the MTFs. 

In 2018, Tricare held an open season for the first time. This change allowed beneficiaries to select plans to meet their needs, and their household budgets. The vision and dental programs were also revamped with the addition of more plans.

Place provided the opening remarks during the Region’s 7th annual Pacific Behavioral Health Summit. The annual summit brings together military and community health care professionals to share the latest behavioral health medical and technological innovations, research topics and approaches to care, improving access to care for beneficiaries.

PEOPLE

Each year the Region takes pride in ongoing efforts to develop civilian and Soldier leaders because people are the foundation of the Region’s success and the key to the future.

LeMaster held a senior leader symposium, bringing together commanders from the Pacific medical arena. During the two-day symposium, participants worked together to refine the RHC-P campaign plan, while also participating in sessions on operationalizing readiness, rapid hiring, leader development, performance planning, MHS GENESIS, and congressional updates on the National Defense Authorization Acts of 2017 and 2019.

Retirees are also a key component of the people who round out this great region. In October 2018, a retiree appreciation event was held in Hawaii to honor and recognize those who have served and continue to serve the military and the community.

HAWAII eMSM AND PUGET SOUND MHS

Lastly, we cannot forget our regional partners, the Puget Sound Military Health System and Hawaii enhanced Multi-Market System, who are co-located at the two headquarters locations and support medical assets for all Services. Both offices contribute to the Army Medicine and RHC-P missions throughout the year. 

LeMaster is the market manager for the Puget Sound MHS, while Place is the market manager for the Hawaii eMSM. LeMaster and Place oversee the efficient use of the joint service medical resources, so patients can access care when they need it, in the most efficient way possible, and at the best cost.

Under the Puget Sound MHS, projects such as the JBLM medical and dental sleep apnea team formed. The team sought to reduce cost and increase readiness for active-duty service members by increasing deployability through use of obstructive sleep apena devices other than a CPAP machine. The efforts were recognized by U.S. Army Medical Command with a Wolf Pack Award.

In 2018, the Hawaii eMSM continued to promote an unrivaled experience of care by leveraging partnerships, technology and resources, while fostering a ready force and healthy, resilient Ohana.

Some highlights include the continuation of a physical therapist initiative which provides inpatient and outpatient services to beneficiaries in MTFs across all Services. The Hawaii eMSM also received accolades for the implementation and management of several programs such as tele-behavioral health capabilities, consolidation of appointment systems into one central phone line and working groups who supported the Rim of the Pacific Exercise.

220,RHC-P reflects upon 2017 accomplishments,"HONOLULU C (Dec. 7, 2017) Regional Health Command-Pacific reflects upon major accomplishments celebrated this year in support of its mission of providing combatant commanders with medically ready forces and ready medical forces conducting health service support in all phases of military operation. 

The Department of Defense's (DoD) new electronic health record, dubbed MHS Genesis, was successfully deployed at Madigan Oct. 21. MHS, which stands for military health system, integrates inpatient and outpatient solutions that will connect medical and dental information across the continuum of care, from point of injury to the military treatment facility. This includes garrison, operational, and en route care, increasing efficiencies for beneficiaries and healthcare professionals. According to a DoD Healthcare management System Modernization factsheet, when fully deployed, MHS Genesis will support the availability of electronic health records for more than 9.4 million DoD beneficiaries and approximately 205,000 Military Health System personnel globally. 

Madigan Army Medical Center, one of the largest military hospitals on the West Coast, opened the Department of Defense’s first Center for Autism, Resources, Education and Services (CARES) at Joint Base Lewis McCord (JBLM), in Washington State on Aug. 9. The center is a joint installation partnership between Madigan and the JBLM Armed Forces Community Service, which focuses on providing patient-centered care for military children with autism and their families.  “We believe that as we provide better support to our special needs kids and their families, our community and military readiness improves.  And that’s something we can all celebrate,” stated Madigan Commanding Officer, Col. Michael Place. Eligible patients receive occupational, physical and speech therapy, Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), Exceptional Family Member Program (EFMP) Systems Navigation, Child Youth School Services (CYSS) Respite Care and more. 

The region also co-hosted the Sixth Annual Behavioral Health Summit, Sept. 7-8 at Tripler Army Medical Center’s Kyser Auditorium, gathering mental health professionals from the Pacific region together to discuss best practices, emerging treatments, research topics and approaches to care to help military families and veterans on their journey towards lifelong resilience. RHC-P Chief of Staff, Col. Laura Trinkle provided opening remarks. ""This summit is a shining example of unity, demonstrating the partnership we share delivering quality healthcare between Army Medicine, our friends at the VA, the behavioral health professionals in our communities and other trusted advocates. We are all here today, on an island in the middle of the Pacific working toward a common goal. Yet the collective improvements gained here will impact the way we deliver world-class medical care not just to our ohana on Oahu - but throughout the entire region.”

A Madigan subordinate unit, the California Medical Detachment from the Presidio of Monterey, began pediatrics and family medicine care in the newly opened Major General William H. Gourley Clinic VA-DoD Outpatient Clinic, located in Seaside, California. The facility, which conducted a ribbon cutting Aug. 3, allows for the treatment of military veterans of the Monterey peninsula military community, along with the family medicine and pediatrics TRICARE Prime patients of the Department of Defense. At the clinic, the VA’s health care system and the Army’s Patient Centered Medical Home model work in harmony, emphasizing the health partnership between patient and provider.  

RHC-P also held the Pacific Warrior Trials, held at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. During the week-long competition which concluded Nov. 10, about 80 wounded, ill, or injured soldiers and veterans from the Pacific region trained and competed in eight adaptive sporting events ranging from swimming, track, field, shooting, archery, cycling, sitting volleyball and wheelchair basketball. Tripler Army Medical Center Commanding Officer, Col. Andrew Barr, summarized his thoughts on the stories he heard from participants, emphasizing the immense sense of accomplishment and resiliency among the Soldiers. ""Through your effort, through your struggle, through your accomplishments, some of you rebelling in victory with medals, but all of you rebelling in your accomplishments and the ability to finish the race, that's what the Warrior Games are all about.""

At the Army level, RHC-P took second place overall in the Army's Best Medic Competition, which concluded Oct. 29 at Camp Bullis, Texas, hosted by the U.S. Army Medical Command and the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School. This year's competition, which included 28 teams, was designed to physically and intellectually challenge medics in a simulated tactical environment. The region was represented by 2nd Lt. Adam Schafer, 65th Medical Brigade and Sgt. Ryan Harpster, Bassett Army Community Hospital at the U.S. Army Best Medic team event alongside other two-person U.S. Army medic teams. ""The most challenging part of the competition was staying sharp and attentive to the small details while I was very physically uncomfortable,"" stated Schafer. ""There was never a point where I was not hot, freezing, sore, in pain or struggling with fire ant bites. It required a mental toughness to push out those distractions which was crucial for our success.""

RHC-P also hosted various high-level distinguished visors to the region, which included the Second Lady of the United States, Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, and the Army Surgeon General. During these visits, RHC-P personnel were able to emphasize many of the outstanding programs, award-winning initiatives and staff making up the region. 

Throughout the year, RHC-P medical personnel also projected global health engagements and humanitarian missions for Nepal, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Palau, Vietnam, Cambodia, China and Mongolia.

221,Marines meet the makers of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle,"YORK, Pa.―Marines from the 3rd Assault Amphibian Battalion―slated to receive the first of the Corps’ new Amphibious Combat Vehicles―received the rare opportunity to visit the ACV’s main production facility and meet with the workforce building the vehicle.

On Oct. 16, representatives from Program Manager Advanced Amphibious Assault at Program Executive Officer Land Systems, Marine Corps Combat Development Command, Combat Development and Integration and 3rd AA Bn. visited one of the ACV’s primary manufacturing facilities in York, Pennsylvania, to tour the assembly line and speak with the contractors in charge of building the Corps’ next-generation vehicles.

Col. Kirk Mullins, program manager of AAA, under which the ACV program falls, said the event was a collective decision between himself and leadership at BAE, the vehicle’s manufacturer.

“We thought it would be really good for the workforce to actually meet some of the Marines for whom they’re building the vehicle―the Marines who will take these vehicles and employ them, potentially in harm’s way,” said Mullins. “From a Marine perspective, we are typically in ‘receive’-mode of new equipment, but we never really truly understand or appreciate how much work and effort goes into making that piece of equipment.”

During the visit, Mullins and his team emphasized the importance of delivering quality vehicles on schedule to BAE’s workforce. In a message that resonated with BAE’s workforce, Mullins stressed the collective responsibility everyone has to provide the best possible products to protect the men and women serving our nation.

“What you do matters and how well you do it is significantly important to the lives of Marines,"" said Mullins to the workforce. “It’s important that we―the collective we―give Marines the very best pieces of equipment, specifically, the very best vehicles we can provide to them. What you do is a matter of life or death for a Marine on the battlefield.""
 
From a high-level perspective, building each ACV is not unlike building a car, albeit a highly sophisticated one. Pieces must be welded together, parts will be integrated and the systems require safety testing once assembled.

Though certain components of the vehicle may be built elsewhere, each vehicle itself is integrated and assembled at York. For a day, the Marine Corps customers were given a behind-the-scenes glimpse of this all in action.

“Seeing the ACV in its various stages of production―from bits and pieces of metal to a full tactical combat vehicle―was definitely enlightening to me,” said Maj. Mark Patridge, a logistics officer from 3rd AA Bn. “What surprised me during our visit―aside from the high-tech stuff that they have there to put the vehicles together―was the level of artisanry, individual skills and personal work required to build each vehicle. It’s actually a very high quality piece of equipment that has had a lot of personal time, personal attention and expertise put into it to be able to provide all of the capabilities that the ACV provides.”

The ACV is the Corps’ answer to the decades-old Assault Amphibious Vehicle, which has been in service since the 1970s. A next-generation vehicle designed to provide increased lethality, survivability and protected mobility to the warfighter, the ACV will be carrying and fighting alongside Marines for generations to come.

“The ACV represents a new chapter in the development of amphibious combat systems, not only building on lessons learned within the amphibious assault community, but also outside the community with its advanced communications systems, weapons systems and the safety features the ACV has to offer,” said Patridge. “The ACV has the potential to enable many of the fundamental concepts―like expeditionary advanced base operations and distributed operations―that the Marine Corps is trying to put into practice.”

The Marine Corps started accepting delivery of the ACV earlier this summer. The AAA program office is currently conducting live fire testing and performing logistics demonstration procedures on the vehicles in preparation for integration, operational tests and evaluation scheduled for next summer.",2019/10/31,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/350019/marines-meet-makers-amphibious-combat-vehicle,"YORK, PA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国宾夕法尼亚州约克,海军陆战队与两栖作战车辆制造商会面,宾夕法尼亚州约克――第三突击两栖作战营的海军陆战队预定接收美国陆军陆战队第一辆新型两栖作战车辆，他们有难得的机会参观ACV的主要生产设施，并与制造车辆的工人会面。10月16日，采办项目经理的代表在采办项目执行官陆地系统部、海军陆战队作战发展司令部、作战发展与集成部和第三陆军基地高级两栖攻击部任职。参观了位于宾夕法尼亚州约克市的ACV主要生产设施之一，参观了装配线，并与负责制造美国陆军新一代车辆的承包商交谈。美国汽车协会（AAA）的项目经理柯克・马林斯（Kirk Mullins）表示，此次活动是他本人和汽车制造商BAE领导层之间的集体决定。马林斯说：“我们认为，让工作人员与他们正在为之建造车辆的一些海军陆战队士兵会面，他们将驾驶这些车辆并使用这些车辆，这对他们来说确实是一件好事。”。“从海军的角度来看，我们通常处于‘接收’新设备的模式，但我们从未真正理解或欣赏制造该设备所花费的工作量和精力。”在访问期间，马林斯和他的团队强调了按时向BAE员工交付高质量车辆的重要性。在与BAE员工产生共鸣的信息中，马林斯强调了每个人都有集体责任提供最好的产品，以保护为国家服务的男男女女。“你做什么以及你做得如何对海军陆战队的生活至关重要，”马林斯对工作人员说。“重要的是，我们集体向海军陆战队提供最好的装备，特别是我们能提供给他们的最好的交通工具。你所做的事关系到一名海军陆战队在战场上的生死。”从高层次的角度来看，制造每一辆ACV与制造一辆汽车没有什么不同，尽管这是一辆非常复杂的汽车。零件必须焊接在一起，零件将集成在一起，系统组装后需要进行安全测试。尽管车辆的某些部件可能在其他地方制造，但每辆汽车本身都是在约克进行集成和组装的。For一天，海军陆战队的客户们在幕后看到了这一切。美国陆军第三航空局Bn的后勤官马克・帕特里奇少校说：“看到ACV从零碎的金属到完整的战术战车的各个生产阶段，对我来说无疑是一种启发。”。“在我们访问期间，除了他们用来组装汽车的高科技设备外，让我惊讶的是制造每辆汽车所需的工匠水平、个人技能和个人工作。我认为，这实际上是一件非常高质量的设备，拥有大量的个人时间、个人注意力和专业知识我们希望它能够提供ACV提供的所有功能。”ACV是美国陆军对已有数十年历史的两栖攻击车的回应，自20世纪70年代以来一直在服役。ACV是一种旨在为作战人员提供更高杀伤力、生存能力和机动保护的下一代车辆，将在未来几代人中与海军陆战队并肩作战。帕特里奇说：“ACV代表着两栖作战系统发展的新篇章，它不仅借鉴了两栖攻击社区内的经验教训，而且借鉴了社区外先进的通信系统、武器系统以及ACV必须提供的安全功能。”。“ACV有潜力实现海军陆战队正在尝试实施的许多基本概念，如远征先进基地作战和分布式作战。”海军陆战队今年夏天早些时候开始接受ACV的交付。AAA项目办公室目前正在对车辆进行实弹测试和后勤演示程序，为明年夏天计划的集成、作战测试和评估做准备。
222,RHC-P empowers Soldiers through NIMS,"HONOLULU, Hawaii (Feb. 21, 2017) -- Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) has rolled out the Army’s Not in My Squad (NIMS) initiative C a grass roots approach to creating a climate of dignity, respect and cohesion.

The Army leadership series builds upon the premise that the best place to check the pulse of an organization and to impact change is at the squad level.  

RHC-P Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention Program Manager, Master Sgt. Kevin Edmondson has spearheaded the workshop initiative for select sergeant and staff sergeant Medical Command (MEDCOM) Soldiers in the Pacific region and says the seminar is structured to test and assess the state of trust and cohesion of squad units, the foundation upon which the Army builds its formations. “During the workshop, participants are asked questions that get them thinking about the challenges that they may be facing. Often times, they realize that the challenges they’ve identified might be shared across the group and that they already have a solution from within their group that can be implemented immediately. This is what our  program facilitators strive to accomplish C to empower squad leaders to not only voice their challenges, but to provide potential solutions in an effort to build and  maintain dignity and respect throughout the command,” said Edmondson. 

Staff Sgt. Dawn Irvine an RHC-P NIMS facilitator, says the initiative reshapes the way change can be made in the Army.  “We’re empowering junior NCOs to come up with their own ways to solve challenges at their level versus having to always to get the solutions from up top. When Soldiers feel they can make change at their level, it helps foster a better environment and culture across the entire team,” she said. 

NIMS is essentially helping Soldiers become better NCOs. With such an important focus, facilitators took extra steps to ensure maximum impact. “We took the Soldiers away from their daily work areas and placed them in a neutral setting and also allowed them to wear civilian attire for the week,” said Edmondson. “This took away uniform barriers and allowed the squad units to more freely speak their minds,” he said.

The workshop concludes with Soldiers briefing any challenges that can’t be solved at their levels to leaders, along with potential solutions. RHC-P command teams can then implement a plan of action to address legitimate concerns that may arise during the NIMS workshop in order to affect positive change, strengthen the organization and improve the Army leadership culture as a whole.

Edmondson, who helped RHC-P become the first organization in the active Army to independently, and without on-site assistance from the Center for the Army Profession and Ethics (CAPE) and Army Research Institute (ARI)  launch the NIMS program, is now set to lead an Army Medical Command-level workshop, along with other RHC-P leaders, Sgt. 1st Class Kristen Stall, Staff Sgt. India Marquez, Staff Sgt. Trisha Ronk and Staff Sgt. Dawn Irvine, March 1-3, 2017. 

Attendees at the workshop will include select non-commissioned officers from all organizations within MEDCOM.

225,Pendleton Marines put Amphibious Combat Vehicle to the test,"The world is constantly advancing around us. As the most feared fighting force in the world, it is imperative Marines advance their capabilities along with it. The Corps’ new Amphibious Combat Vehicle is here to improve Marines’ amphibious capabilities. 

Marines with the Amphibious Vehicle Test Branch, Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity, tested the ACV’s maneuverability and performance during low-light and night operations on Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton’s beaches, Dec. 16-18. The Marines spent hours driving ACVs the Southern California surf and in the open ocean to assess how well they could interface with the vehicle and conduct operations in low light.
  
“AVTB has been on Camp Pendleton since 1943,” said David Sandvold, the director of operations for AVTB. “We are the only branch in the military who uses our warfighters to test equipment that is in development.” 

The ACV will be replacing the Amphibious Assault Vehicle starting in late 2020. The AAV has been in service since 1972, serving in countries around the world. The AAV has been the go-to vehicle to carry Marines and gear from ship to shore, but with adversaries around the world growing more powerful, the ACV was created to enhance the capabilities of ship to shore missions and amphibious assaults. 

The ACV will come in four different variants derived from the armored personnel carrier base. There’s a recovery variant, a command and control variant, and an up-armed variant to engage enemy armored vehicles. Each ACV comes equipped with eight wheels instead of the tracks originally on the AAV. 

“It’s a huge difference on how the ACV and the AAV drive and handle,” said Marine Sgt. Fernando Alvarez, an AAV operator with AVTB. “The main difference (with wheels) is that it’s a lot faster on land. But instead of pivoting like the AAV, we have to make three-point turns now, which is not a problem.”
 
The ACV powers through high surf, traverses over trenches and trucks over sloped terrain. The ACV’s significant protective assets make it resilient to direct attacks and allow it to operate with degraded mobility in an ever-changing battle environment. The vehicle possesses sufficient lethality to deliver accurate fire support to infantry, whether stationary or on the move.

“Technology is modernizing,” explained Sandvold. “As we learn about the ACV, we see everything it has to offer.” 

The ACV also has a unique V-shape underbelly to deflect the blast of improvised explosive devices. Since IED’s were the most lethal weapons used against AAV’s, the new ACV was designed to take a blast from an IED, continue the mission and bring Marines home safely.

“I am loyal to tracks, but the more I learn about these vehicles, the more impressed I get with all its features and how it will improve our warfighting capabilities,” said Sandvold.",2019/12/20,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/356865/pendleton-marines-put-amphibious-combat-vehicle-test,"CAMP PENDLETON, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州彭德尔顿营地,彭德尔顿海军陆战队对两栖作战车辆进行了测试,世界在我们周围不断前进。作为世界上最令人畏惧的战斗力量，海军陆战队必须提高自身能力。美国海军陆战队的新型两栖作战车辆是为了提高海军陆战队的两栖作战能力。12月16日至18日，海军陆战队战术系统支持活动两栖车辆测试分队的海军陆战队在彭德尔顿海军陆战队基地的海滩上，在微光和夜间作战中测试了ACV的机动性和性能。海军陆战队花了数小时驾驶ACV在南加州冲浪和公海中，以评估他们与车辆的接口以及在弱光下进行操作的能力。“自1943年以来，AVTB一直在彭德尔顿营地，”AVTB的运营总监David Sandwold说。“我们是军队中唯一一个使用我们的作战人员测试正在开发中的装备的部门。”ACV将从2020年底开始取代两栖攻击车。AAV自1972年起投入使用，服务于世界各国。AAV一直是将海军陆战队和装备从一艘船运送到另一艘船的通行工具，但随着世界各地的对手越来越强大，ACV的诞生是为了增强船对岸任务和两栖攻击的能力。ACV将有四种不同的变种，它们来自装甲运兵车基地。有一种恢复型，一种指挥控制型，还有一种上装型，用来对付敌人的装甲车。每个ACV都配备了八个车轮，而不是AAV上最初的轨道。AVTB的AAV操作员、海军陆战队中士费尔南多・阿尔瓦雷斯（Fernando Alvarez）说：“ACV和AAV的驾驶和操控方式有着巨大的差异。”。“主要的区别（带轮子）是它在陆地上的速度要快得多。但是我们现在必须做三点转弯，而不是像AAV那样旋转，这不是一个问题。”ACV通过高浪驱动，穿过沟渠，卡车穿过斜坡。ACV的重要保护资产使其能够抵御直接攻击，并允许其在不断变化的作战环境中以降级的机动性运行。该车具有足够的杀伤力，可以为步兵提供精确的火力支援，无论是静止的还是移动的。“技术正在现代化，”桑德沃尔德解释道。“随着我们对ACV的了解，我们看到了它所能提供的一切。”ACV还有一个独特的V形下腹，可以偏转简易爆炸装置的爆炸。由于IED是对付AAV最致命的武器，新的ACV被设计用来承受IED的爆炸，继续执行任务并将海军陆战队安全带回家。“我忠于轨道，但我对这些车辆了解得越多，我对其所有功能以及它将如何提高我们的作战能力印象就越深刻。”桑德沃德说。
226,Marine Corps will start fielding Amphibious Combat Vehicle,"Marine Corps Base Quantico, Va.―Marines will soon start receiving the long-awaited Amphibious Combat Vehicle.

Program Executive Officer Land Systems approved initial fielding of the Marine Corps’ new ACV, which will eventually replace the Corps’ legacy Assault Amphibious Vehicles. 

“This is truly a significant moment, given the many years the Marine Corps has invested in trying to replace the AAV,” said Col. Kirk Mullins, program manager for Advanced Amphibious Assault at PEO Land Systems. “While we still have work ahead of us, this is a historical first step toward delivering this materiel capability to our Marines, which is what our mission is all about.”

The initial fielding decision, which the PEO finalized in late September, enables the AAA program office to start distributing the vehicle to the fleet. The Marine Corps will deliver the first set of ACVs―the personnel-carrier variant―to Marines starting in October.

In the future, the Corps intends to develop, procure and field three additional variants that specialize in command and control, recovery operations and increased firepower.

The ACV is designed to fully replace the Corps’ aging fleet of AAVs through the 2020s. Expeditionary and modernized in design, the ACV integrates with naval shipping and ship-to-shore connectors. The ACV’s ability to use the ocean and waterways to carry Marines and equipment make it well-suited for various operating environments, including Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations.",2020/9/28,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/378851/marine-corps-will-start-fielding-amphibious-combat-vehicle,"MARINE CORPS BASE QUANTICO, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州匡蒂科海军陆战队基地,海军陆战队将开始部署两栖作战车辆,弗吉尼亚州匡蒂科海军陆战队基地――海军陆战队不久将开始接收期待已久的两栖作战车辆。项目执行官陆地系统部批准了海军陆战队新型ACV的初步部署，该车辆将最终取代海军陆战队遗留的两栖攻击车辆。“鉴于海军陆战队多年来一直在努力更换AAV，这确实是一个重要时刻，”PEO陆地系统公司高级两栖攻击项目经理柯克・马林斯上校说。“虽然我们还有工作要做，但这是向我们的海军陆战队交付这种装备能力的历史性第一步，这也是我们的使命所在。”PEO在9月底最终确定的最初部署决定，使AAA项目办公室能够开始向舰队分发车辆。海军陆战队将从10月开始向海军陆战队交付第一套ACV（人员运载器变体）。未来，海军陆战队打算开发、采购和部署另外三种专门用于指挥和控制的变体，恢复行动和增强火力。ACV的设计目的是在20世纪20年代完全取代美国陆军部老化的AAV机队。远征和现代化的设计，ACV集成了海军航运和船岸连接器。ACV能够利用海洋和水路运送海军陆战队和设备，因此非常适合各种作战环境，包括远征先进基地作战。
227,P-S GAR celebrates Month of the Military Child,"PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. C Col. James Smith, Peterson-Schriever Garrison commander, signed a proclamation to begin Month of the Military Child for the garrison on April 2, 2021. Activities for the month long celebration include a door decorating contest, a masquerade ball, a gratitude garden and community library grand opening. 

“It’s a time that the community can come together and support military-connected children,” said Ruth Moore, Schriever Air Force Base school liaison. “These kids deserve our support as they support their family members who serve.” 

In 1986, Defense Secretary Casper Weinberg established April as Month of the Military Child in order to celebrate military children and the sacrifices they make in order for their loved ones to continue to serve our country. A parent’s military career can be difficult on children; from constantly changing schools and having to make new friends, to saying goodbye to their parents for months on end. This requires an underestimated amount of resiliency and strength.

“The official flower of the military child is the dandelion,” said Moore. “The plant puts down roots almost anywhere, and it’s almost impossible to destroy.""

The garrison community is also encouraged to participate in “Purple-Up Day” on April 16. When combining the official colors of each military branch it creates purple; which symbolizes support for military families and children.

A complete list of garrison Month of the Military Child events can be found on the 21st and the 50th Force Support Squadron websites.

230,Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month in RHC-P,"HONOLULU C April is Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month. Regional Health Command-Pacific’s command team signed a proclamation here recently signifying its support for eliminating sexual assault and harassment in the Army.

Brig. Gen. Jack M. Davis, commanding general of RHC-P, and Sgt. Maj. Conrad Walters, acting command sergeant major, signed the proclamation to bring awareness to and show support of the Army’s continuing efforts to eliminate sexual assault and harassment, something the leaders called “a scourge” on the service’s reputation, ethics and values.

The Army continues to fight sexual harassment and assault in its ranks, increasing the amount of money and personnel in the fight to reduce the number of incidents, leaders said.

Despite the Army’s efforts, however, reported instances of sexual harassment and assault continue to increase, according to results of a Department of Defense study released last year.

The study, reflecting data from Fiscal Year 2018, found a “statistically significant increase” of sexual assault in the military.

The study stated that about 6.2 percent of active duty women indicated having experienced a sexual assault in the year before the survey, up from the 4.3 percent measured in the 2016 survey. The estimated prevalence rate for active duty men in the 2018 survey was 0.7 percent, statistically unchanged from the previous assessment.

Using these rates, the DoD said, an estimated 20,500 service members experienced some kind of sexual assault in 2018, up from 2016’s estimate of approximately 14,900.

Sgt. 1st Class Melissa Arizmendi, RHC-P’s SHARP program manager, said her office is adjusting its emphasis in an effort to change trends and reduce incidents in the command.

“We have focused on response since the start of the program,” Arizmendi said. “Now, we are focusing more on prevention.”

Arizmendi said this year’s SAAPM theme is, “Building Cohesive Teams through Character, Trust, and Resilience. Protecting Our People Protects Our Mission.”

“This theme was chosen because character and trust are the cornerstones of cohesive teams, and cohesive teams are built by engaged leaders that are trusted by their subordinates,” she said.

Arizmendi said RHC-P’s SHARP office is using some new tactics in the battle against sexual assault and harassment.

“We are working to ensure that incoming personnel get a responsible sponsor,” she said. “These personnel get SHARP training within days, so they know the risks for their area.”

Arizmendi has been the RHC-P SHARP program manager since August, 2017, and said the team works directly with equal opportunity and equal employment opportunity teams to ensure all service members, civilians, contractors and family members are shown the required dignity and respect.

“Anyone witnessing an event outside of dignity and respect is asked to intervene,” she said. “Workplace inspections are conducted on a regular basis.

“Leaders must not tolerate any form of sexual harassment or assault,” she said.

There are a number of resources available to RHC-P members who feel they have been sexually assaulted or harassed, Arizmendi said.

“If they are unable or unwilling to visit the SHARP office, they can use any other SHARP office, the chaplain, behavioral health, special victims’ counsel, office of personnel management, DoD Safe helpline, Military OneSource, the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network, or their local installation 24/7 hotline,” she said.

“Victims of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault will have different needs based on their individual situation, option they choose to report, and willingness to share,” Arizmendi added.

There are two types of reporting available to victims of sexual harassment or assault: restricted and unrestricted.

Arizmendi said restricted reporting gives the victim the opportunity to report the incident, receive SHARP services, get medical treatment, including a sexual assault forensic examination, and receive legal services, including having a dedicated special victim advocate with more control over release of information.

An unrestricted report includes all the above as well as support from the command, a military protective order, civilian protective order, and an investigation, with the ability to charge the alleged offender with a crime.

Arizmendi, a licensed practical nurse, said Sexual Assault Awareness Month has been observed nationwide since 2001, after building on efforts since the 1970s to bring more attention to the problem.

Arizmendi said her job as the SHARP program manager fits her personality.

“I enjoy helping people,” she said. “It has always been part of my identity. I also like that at this level, I can have an influence on change and policy rewrites.”

231,PHC-P Soldier and entomologist promoted to lieutenant colonel,"TRIPLER ARMY MEDICAL CENTER, Hawaii -- Public Health Command C Pacific chief of Operations, Hee Kim, was promoted to lieutenant colonel on Jan. 1, 2020.

In honor of Kim’s promotion, a ceremony was held Jan. 24 at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii. Col. Heidi Mon., PHC-P commander, was the host of ceremony.
  
“Good afternoon one and all, and thank you all for joining me today on this auspicious occasion of the promotion of Hee Kim to lieutenant colonel,” said Mon. “If you have been to a promotion ceremony or two you are probably expecting me to say that Hee is a great Army officer and he is. He is likely the smartest person that I know, and I am surrounded by brilliant minds in Public Health Command C Pacific. But Maj. Kim, Lt. Col. Kim, is extraordinarily bright, as well as perceptive, creative, and enterprising.”

Kim represents one of 59 active duty Entomology officers currently serving in the U.S. Army. In 1991, Kim and his family emigrated from Seoul, South Korea, to the United States. Since leaving South Korea, Kim always wanted to practice Medical Entomology, and after the Sept. 11 attacks, those two factors solidified his desire to join the Army in 2005. 
 
“I give this glory and honor to God first and foremost, because it is amazing what he has allowed me to accomplish throughout my life,” said Kim. “I was an immigrant boy who didn’t speak a lick of English at 11 years old, and just had a fascination with bugs. Fast forward 29 years later, here we are in this awesome setting, sharing this special moment with friends and family.”

Kim recognized his fellow officers, enlisted Soldiers and Army Civilian employees, adding they are the biggest reason he is where he is today.

“I love promotions, because they are a platform that we can use to thank those people who put you here. We have all been in this business for a long time, you don’t get here by yourself,” said Kim. “I want to thank everyone who has been instrumental in my place here.”
  
Kim also thanked friends and family for attending the ceremony, particularly Mirka, his wife of 14 years.

“I really appreciate your support, and how amazing and talented you are,” said Kim “If you didn’t know, she is an artist, and keeps a professional career while also caring for our three children and me ??C amazing!”

Kim also thanked his children, Aila, Eelis, and Liina.  
 
“I know I said this before when I got my Ph.D., but daddy loves you, and I do this every day for you guys,” said Kim. 

As the ceremony came to a close, Kim was presented the Order of Military Medical Merit medallion for distinguished service, excellence, and promoting fellowship and espirit de corps among Army Medical Department personnel.

Membership in the order recognizes those individuals who have clearly demonstrated the highest standards of integrity and moral character, displayed an outstanding degree of professional competence, with selflessness, and have made a sustained contribution to the betterment of Army Medicine.",2020/2/3,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/361705/phc-p-soldier-and-entomologist-promoted-lieutenant-colonel,"HONOLULU, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],檀香山，你好，美国,PHC-P士兵和昆虫学家晋升为中校,夏威夷TRIPLER陆军医疗中心――公共卫生司令部――太平洋作战司令Hee Kim于2020年1月1日晋升为中校。为纪念Kim的晋升，1月24日在夏威夷珍珠港希卡姆联合基地举行了仪式。PHC-P指挥官Heidi Mon上校主持了仪式。“大家下午好，谢谢你们今天和我一起参加这个喜庆的场合，把希金提升为中校。”蒙说。“如果你参加过一两次晋升仪式，你可能希望我说Hee是一位伟大的陆军军官，他确实是。他可能是我所认识的最聪明的人，我周围都是太平洋公共卫生司令部的才华横溢的人。但是金少校，金中校，非常聪明，而且有洞察力，有创造力，而且非常聪明。”金代表目前在美国陆军服役的59名现役昆虫学军官之一。1991年，金正日和他的家人从韩国首尔移民到美国。自离开韩国以来，金正恩一直想从事医学昆虫学研究，而在9・11袭击后，这两个因素使他在2005年参军的愿望更加坚定。金说：“我把这份荣耀和荣誉首先献给上帝，因为他让我一生都能完成的事情令人惊讶。”。“我是一个移民男孩，11岁时一点英语都不会说，只是对虫子很着迷。快进29年后，我们来到了这个令人敬畏的环境中，与朋友和家人分享这一特殊时刻。”Kim认出了他的同事、士兵和军队文职雇员，金说：“我喜欢促销活动，因为这是一个平台，我们可以用来感谢那些让你来到这里的人。我们都从事这一行业很长时间了，你不是一个人来的。”。“我要感谢所有在我这里发挥作用的人。”金姆还感谢朋友和家人参加仪式，特别是他14年的妻子米尔卡。“我真的很感谢你的支持，以及你是多么的了不起和有才华，”金姆说“如果你不知道，她是一名艺术家，在照顾我们的三个孩子和我的同时保持着职业生涯――太棒了！”金姆还感谢了他的孩子，艾拉、伊利斯和莉娜。“我知道我在拿到博士学位时说过这句话，但爸爸爱你们，我每天都为你们这样做。”仪式接近尾声时，金正日被授予军事医学功勋勋章，以表彰其卓越的服务、卓越的表现以及在陆军医疗部门人员中促进团契和团队精神。该勋章的成员资格认可那些明确表现出最高标准的完整性的个人具有高尚的道德品质，表现出卓越的专业能力和无私奉献精神，为军队医疗事业的发展做出了持续的贡献。

233,Acting SecAF Matthew P. Donovan visits Tyndall,"Honorable Matthew P. Donovan, acting Secretary of the Air Force, visited Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, June 2, 2019, after assuming the position June 1.

“It’s our privilege to be the first base visit for our [acting] Secretary of the Air Force, the Honorable Matthew Donovan,” said Col. Brian Laidlaw, 325th Fighter Wing commander.

Donovan was stationed at Tyndall twice when he served in the military. He flew the U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagle fighter aircraft in the 1990s as an instructor pilot and later as an Air Combat Command demonstration pilot. He returned to Tyndall in 2001 as the 95th Fighter Squadron commander. 

“It’s really great to be back in Bay County and Panama City and Tyndall AFB,” Donovan said. “It was the best time of my life here, flying Eagles on the beach.”

Donovan toured the base to see the destruction Hurricane Michael caused, the recovery efforts already completed and future plans for the base rebuild.

“It’s really important that we continue to advocate for Tyndall AFB and getting it rebuilt,” Donovan said. “We’re cautiously optimistic that we’re pretty close on a supplemental now.”

Donovan held a press conference during his visit, discussing the strategic importance of Tyndall and answering questions about updates on the base’s recovery. He also met with Tyndall Airmen to thank them for their hard work, resiliency and dedication to execute the mission.

“I want to put a shout out to all the Airmen,” Donovan said. “That was always the best part of any tour I had in the Air Force, was interacting with the Airmen cause they’re what makes it so special.”",2019/6/3,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/325317/acting-secaf-matthew-p-donovan-visits-tyndall,"TYNDALL AIR FORCE BASE, FL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佛罗里达州廷德尔空军基地,代理秘书马修・P・多诺万访问廷德尔,尊敬的空军代理部长马修・多诺万（Matthew P.Donovan）于2019年6月2日就任后访问了佛罗里达州廷德尔空军基地。布赖恩・莱德劳上校说：“我们很荣幸成为我们空军代理部长马修・多诺万（Matthew Donovan）的首次基地访问。”，第325战斗机联队指挥官。多诺万在军队服役时曾两次驻扎在廷德尔。20世纪90年代，他作为教练飞行员驾驶美国空军F-15鹰式战斗机，后来又作为空战司令部示范飞行员。他于2001年返回廷德尔，担任第95战斗机中队指挥官。多诺万说：“回到海湾县、巴拿马城和廷德尔空军基地真是太棒了。”。“这是我生命中最美好的时光，在海滩上飞翔的老鹰。”多诺万参观了基地，了解了飓风迈克尔造成的破坏、已经完成的恢复工作以及基地重建的未来计划。“我们继续支持廷德尔空军基地并使其得到重建，这真的很重要，”多诺万说。多诺万在访问期间举行了一次新闻发布会，讨论了廷德尔的战略重要性，并回答了有关基地恢复最新情况的问题。他还会见了廷德尔空军，感谢他们为执行任务所付出的辛勤工作、坚韧精神和献身精神。“我想向所有空军发出一声呐喊，”多诺万说。“这一直是我在空军的任何一次旅行中最精彩的部分，与飞行员的互动是因为他们让这一切变得如此特别。”
234,Sailors and Marines Integrate Aboard John P. Murtha,"By Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Kyle Carlstrom, USS John P. Murtha Public Affairs

PACIFIC OCEAN C Sailors and Marines aboard the San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship USS John P. Murtha (LPD 26) are preparing for their upcoming deployment by learning to combine their individual skills to complete ship, strike group and Marine missions.

As part of the Boxer Amphibious Ready Group (ARG), John P. Murtha Sailors and the Marines of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) are using their current at-sea time to further interoperability aboard the ship and within the ARG.

“The ability to integrate with our sister services is one of the fundamentals that makes the U.S. military the best in the world,” said Capt. Anthony Roach, commanding officer of John P. Murtha. “Bringing combat and/or “soft” power to bear anywhere in the world continues to demonstrate our resolve to our partner nations. Without that integration and ability to answer the call worldwide we couldn’t be the leaders of the international community that the world expects from us.”
From daily flight operations to replenishments-at-sea, the Sailors and Marines find themselves working hand-in-hand, ensuring success in each task. 

“We always have areas that we can improve upon but the key take-away is the relationships and trust that we’re building between the Sailors and Marines,” said Roach. “Fostering and nurturing those good relationships now in training will facilitate accurate and efficient response when needed, whether that’s in combat or during a potential humanitarian assistance mission. The relationships built this winter and spring will carry us through to success whatever deployment brings.”

Sailors and Marines also benefit from the integration by getting hands-on experience with new equipment in a different environment.

236,RHC-P supports blood safety program in Cambodia,"JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash. C A team of medical professionals from Regional Health Command-Pacific’s medical treatment facilities and units, in partnership with U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and the U.S. Army in the Pacific, recently supported a blood safety global health engagement in the Kingdom of Cambodia. 

Lt. Col. Teresa Terry, Chief, Clinical Laboratory and Blood Operations, 18th Medical Command (Deployment Support) has been overseeing this humanitarian assistance and disaster relief health engagement effort.

“A focus of the Blood Safety Program in Cambodia is to support vital lifesaving efforts through the improvement of blood product collection, manufacturing and storage,” said Terry.  

This recent mission in Cambodia marks the grand opening of two blood donor centers, and paves the way for the next step, which is the accreditation of the facilities. During the trip another milestone was achieved with the help of the first volunteer blood donors, where blood was collected at these new facilities.

“The highlight for this mission was the completion of the last two out of five U.S. Indo-PACOM funded Blood Transfusion Centers in Cambodia,” said Terry. “The completion of this phase of the project culminated with a ribbon cutting event which was attended by the Cambodia Ministry of Health and representatives from the U.S. Embassy in Cambodia,” Terry added. 

Providing a safe and secure blood supply while improving quality processes with Cambodian blood bank laboratory staff was also a key phase of this project. 

“Lt. Col. Terry and I accomplished another phase of this project which included standardization and validation of equipment for new and relocated instruments used for blood collection,” said Sgt. 1st Class Jason Timberlake, Dept. of Pathology, Madigan.

The overall effort from the entire team was a contribution to the international community and went towards building the host nation’s biosecurity capacity as well as a sustainable blood program to support humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

237,RHC-P brings awareness to breast cancer in October,"JOINT BASE LEWIS-MCCHORD, Wash. -- October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and each year health professionals in the United States rally to bring awareness to an international health issue that affects both women and men. Regional Health Command-Pacific and its providers at its military treatment facilities are part of the health care professionals who provide support in the form of screening, prevention awareness, treatment, and after-care to those who are affected by the disease.

At RHC-P’s medical centers, Saturday breast cancer screening events will be held to increase access to care opportunities for beneficiaries. Tripler Army Medical Center’s Family Medicine Clinic providers have partnered with Tripler’s Radiology Department to conduct a Women's Wellness Clinic that will offer both pap smears and mammogram screenings to eligible beneficiaries in Hawaii. While RHC-P’s Madigan Army Medical Center will host its third annual breast cancer screening event for their eligible beneficiaries in the Pacific Northwest.

According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related death in women.  Lung cancer is the number one cancer that kills women each year. In 2018, there will be approximately 40,920 breast cancer deaths, and over 330,000 new cases of breast cancer among women in the United States. According to the National Breast Cancer Foundation, one in eight women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. 

A World Health Organization study found that breast cancer is the most common cancer in women globally, and affects countries at all levels of modernization. But breast cancer does not only affect women.

238,RHC-P staff awarded for medical readiness contribution,"HONOLULU, Hawaii (July 9, 2018) --- Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) inducts four new members into prestigious Order of the Military Medical Merit, also known as O2M3. 

Founded in 1982 by the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Health Service Command, the honor recognizes people who have served in the Army Medical Department and through selflessness, have made a sustained contribution to the betterment of Army Medicine. 

RHC-P Commanding General, Brig. Gen. Dennis LeMaster, spoke during the ceremony and emphasized the significance of the award and the arduous selection process. “This award is a big deal and very hard to attain. You’ve had to prove yourselves with contributions having been…recognized, codified, presented and decided upon,” Lemaster said as he congratulated recipients. 

The region’s newest inductees, Master Sgt. James Falls and Sgt. First Class Kristen Stalls from Public Health Command-Pacific, as well as Sgt. First Class Monias Allen and Anton Smith from Regional Health Command-Pacific demonstrated high standards of integrity, moral character and professional competence, earning them the award. 

“Every day I try and do something that inches me closer to a better tomorrow. For me…I’m just doing my job and doing it to my best ability. But to have someone take notice and think me worthy of such an award is a huge surprise and a special honor,” Allen said. 

Falls also shared his sentiment in receiving the medal. “This award is an achievement that a lot of people strive for…the pinnacle of awards in Army Medicine and to be approved and accepted into this very small and professional community is an honor for me,” said Stalls. 

Stalls, who thanked RHC-P Soldier, Master Sgt. Kevin Edmondson for the nomination, says she hopes that earning the recognition provides an example for other Soldiers. “I am so thankful and am honored. This is an opportunity to inspire other Soldiers to go above and beyond and find opportunities where you can do more than what’s required,” Stalls added.  

Smith, who is now the Hospital Administrator and Chief Executive Officer at Shriners Hospitals for Children, a Pediatric Specialty Care non-profit, expressed his appreciation for the recognition. ""I am honored to have received this prestigious award and am deeply humbled to be counted among such a high caliber group of Soldiers and civilians, stated Smith.

239,RHC-P names 2018 Best Warrior winners,"HONOLULU (May 17, 2018) C A Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) Soldier and Non-Commissioned Officer take home the title of 2018 RHC-P Best Warrior. 

Sgt. Noel Gonzalez, 18th Medical Command (Deployment Support) and Spc. Jan Leo Ras, Dental Health Command-Pacific are the winners of the region’s premier competition, earning a designation as the command’s finest Soldiers, demonstrating commitment to Army values, embodying the Warrior Ethos and representing the force of the future. 

During the three-day challenge, 17 Soldiers from across the command vied for the top spot, where their knowledge, skills and abilities were tested through urban warfare simulations, formal board interviews, physical fitness challenges, written exams and warrior tasks and battle drills. 

The rigorous events are designed to represent today’s operating environment and to develop Soldiers to think critically in a complex and ever changing environment. 

Brig. Gen. Bertram Providence, RHC-P commanding general, provided remarks during the ceremony and highlighted that competitions like Best Warrior are a reminder of how important Army Medicine’s capability is to the warfighter. “With an all-time high survival rate exceeding 90 percent, the Army marches forward with the knowledge that the medic marches right alongside them,” stated Providence.

The commanding general also added that, while RHC-P is an organization that consists of medical personnel, each service member must always remember that being a Soldier comes first. “When battles are waged, it is the medic that may be called upon to climb a mountain in order to render life-saving aid to wounded comrades. But we must first get to the top of that mountain…and then get back down, with patient in tow.  And that takes strength C strength that was displayed among these competitors here today,” he said.

Providence also encouraged the Best Warrior candidates to take their knowledge and share it with other Soldiers. 

Gonzalez, who described his reaction as in shock when his name was called, says he’s relieved the competition is over, but knows the work isn’t done yet. “I have a big responsibility on my shoulder because I’ve got to represent Regional Health Command-Pacific in the next level of the competition,” said Gonzalez. 

The region’s Non-Commissioned Officer of the Year also added his thoughts on what he’ll cherish most about the competition. “The highlight was definitely the other competitors. These guys were a bunch of great people. They made it that much more bearable, especially in the toughest times with lack of sleep, long miles, hard events, but it was good stuff,” Gonzalez added.  

Ras, much like Gonzalez, had no idea he would take home the tile. “It took me by surprise when they called my name. I didn’t think to step forward. I felt someone else might have had the edge over me the entire time so I didn’t expect it at all,” stated Ras. 

The region’s Soldier of the Year says also sid that Best Warrior prepares Soldiers for the next level. “Waking up early in the morning and pushing through until late at night, it really tests your physical and mental abilities. Over the course of three days, you’ve got to keep your composure. You’ve got to maintain your bearing,” said Ras. 

Reflecting back on the competition, Ras also said he’s gained a new perspective of Soldier readiness levels across RHC-P. “I can see that Soldiers represented across RHC-P in the competition are extremely strong competitors. They are all very well trained. They put up a very tough fight. Overall, I am overjoyed to have completed the competition alongside these other warriors. I want to congratulate all of the competitors for an outstanding job,” he added.   

While only two Soldiers were selected, Master Sgt. Fulton Winder III, RHC-P Best Warrior Competition non-commissioned officer in charge, says he’s proud of the level of Soldier readiness, grit and endurance that competitors displayed during the competition. “Every Soldier competed well and showed the tenacity to finish the events. There is no other option in war, but to win. And that’s what the Soldiers did…compete to win. Because in combat, there are no trophies for second place.”

The win also qualifies the RHC-P Best Warriors for the next phase of the competition at the Army Medical Command level competition in June.

240,RHC-P enhancing readiness through human resources,"Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) is enhancing medical readiness through an unlikely avenue C the human resources department.

RHC-P held a training and leadership summit Feb. 5-9 in Honolulu, Hawaii, where 45 G-1 professionals and select staff came together from across the pacific region to enhance leadership capabilities, increase knowledge-base in the field and to refine hiring and personnel management processes. 

“Army hospitals and support units are as good as the doctors and team members that work in them. Our team of G-1 professionals are responsible for bringing in the best of the best so that military members, their families, and retirees get the best healthcare possible,” said Col. Samantha Hinchman, RHC-P G-1 director. “When we enhance health, we enhance medical readiness, as well as family wellness. There’s a direct correlation there and we have an important role to play in the hiring, retaining and leading of healthcare providers and support staff,” she said. 

Summit leaders also emphasized the G-1’s vision and how RHC-P nested with the Army’s Medical Command, which is the higher headquarters for RHC-P. Attendees also received information on the way ahead for military and civilian human resources and how to better coordinate in the execution of tasks. 

“We were able to share ideas and processes that enabled us to streamline some functions while pointing out possible issues and how to avoid them,” said Daniel Blashill, the chief of military human resources at Medical Activity-Alaska. “The goal is for the RHC-P G-1 folks to attain top proficiency so that we ensure Soldier and civilian readiness,” he added. 

As part of the agenda, participants also completed a training from the Arbinger Institute, which, according to the foundation’s website, equips employees with practical strategies and tools to implement an outward mindset approach to their work. 

“It was extremely important for us to include this mentoring and coaching aspect to the summit since enabling excellence starts with leaders who not only embrace an outward mindset but practice it on a daily basis. This training further cultivates a leadership approach that moves beyond conflict resolution to conflict transformation,” said Kimberly Reinbrecht, chief of civilian human resources for RHC-P. “This commitment to leadership will no doubt positively impact all aspects of human resources, which, at the end of the day, makes our organization better as we contribute to the medical readiness mission,” added Reinbrecht.

241,Fairchild supports Marine Battery P to ‘Fire Mission!’,"At the ready:
On a brisk October morning, The Marines of Battery P, 5th Battalion, 14th Marines, 4th Marine Division, U.S. Marine Forces Reserve, stood ready at their firing positions in the hills of the Yakima Training Center, WA.

Four artillery gun sections stood camouflaged against the surrounding scrubland, unimposing at a distance; a battery of Marines milled about handling minor tasks and talked amongst themselves as they waited.

“Fire mission! Fire mission!” squawked the radio at artillery gun emplacement two.

“Fire mission! Fire mission!” the team of Marines cried out in unison as they leaped to task, dropping everything else.

The gun section leader, Staff Sgt. Alexx Bullion, Reserve Marine Battery P 5/14 artillery section chief, huddles with the radio operator to receive specifics from the battery’s fire direction center on the number of shots, ammunition type, fuse setting, charge strength, bearing and elevation. The chief relays the directions to the hustling crew and in one swift motion, the Marines of gun emplacement two readied their Howitzer with well-oiled precision.

Fairchild reinforces USMC Battery P:
Marine Battery P commenced their latest exercise October 11-14, 2017, one of four live-fire artillery exercises performed each year, in addition to small-arms marksmanship and machine gun training. This most recent display of skill was a direct result of their dedicated training efforts, aided by the support of Fairchild Air Force Base.

“We've been working with Fairchild for the past five years to service the guns, not long after the M777 Howitzer was adopted for use with this unit,” said Capt. Andrew J. Miller, Spokane U.S. Marine Corps support inspector instructor. “We service the guns at the base when possible, because they have the maintenance spaces with the overhead cranes needed to lift the barrels from the howitzers for high-level servicing. It saves us a lot of time and headache it would take to maintain the guns otherwise.”

This support is possible due to service agreements the Department of Defense provides, allowing different service branches and allied partners to assist one another, saving resources, time and money.

“We all fall under the DoD as one military, so the funding also comes from one place and is dispersed according to needs,” said Tech. Sgt. James Williams, 92nd Logistics Readiness Squadron plans and programs NCO in charge. “If Fairchild can support any of our sister service team members, we will do so.”

Battery P lives a significant distance away from a Marine base, so Fairchild fills the gap; supporting them with medical care, continuing education, legal assistance, chapel services and even housing.

""We have a healthy relationship with Fairchild,” Miller said. “We don't have allocation or space for everything here as we are stationed far from the rest of our cloth, so it’s great to have support for our troops and our mission.”

Battery P means business:
""Papa Battery is a Marine Core artillery unit that utilizes six M777A2 155 mm lightweight, medium-towed Howitzers,” said Miller. “They have the mission of providing fire support to infantry ground forces down-range, typically the reserve component, but may serve the active component if the need arises.”

An artillery Battery is expected to be self-sufficient when deployed, where each Marine is charged with providing multiple roles as weapon systems crew and fighters to handle missions, security and transport, Miller said.

“These Reserve Marines are highly skilled to operate these weapon systems,"" Miller said. “Their performance speaks to their level of dedication to the mission, to their personal sacrifice and accomplishments. Their proficiency is amazing if you consider that they only shoot four times a year vs. an active unit that receives significantly more time training.”

Battery P has safely and accurately fired over 2,000, 155mm projectiles during training exercises over the past year, said Gunnery Sgt. Alton Currie, Battery P 5-14 operations chief.

“It was a good exercise. Training readiness standards is our top priority,” Currie said. “Some Marines have stepped up to greater responsibilities as new emplacement chiefs and this was essential training for them, breaking out all our gear and working with it to get ready for the year ahead.”

Semper Fidelis:
The breech is opened; the barrel cleared, oiled and made ready for action. The loader lugs a 100-pound, 155 mm projectile to the gun, and has Bullion check the fuze prior to placing it onto the loading slide. A long metal rod wielded by two Marines ram the ordnance into the barrel, propellant charges are added; the breach closed and locked.

A Marine announces the gun is ready to fire. Bullion raises his hand: “Prepare to fire!” he warns, less than a minute after the crew was given the fire mission order.

“Fire!” Bullion ordered with a chopping motion.

The howitzer thundered: firing with a power that quaked the ground, causing the surrounding dirt and dust to fly into the air; the shockwave crashing against the crew and reverberating throughout the firing position.

“Reload!” Bullion ordered -- the firing process began anew.",2017/11/21,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/258038/fairchild-supports-marine-battery-p-fire-mission,"FAIRCHILD AIR FORCE BASE, WA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国华盛顿州飞兆半导体空军基地,飞兆半导体支持海军P号炮台执行“火力任务！”,准备就绪：10月一个轻快的早晨，美国海军陆战队预备役第4海军陆战队师第14海军陆战队第5营P炮台的海军陆战队在西澳州亚基马训练中心山丘上的射击阵地做好了准备。四个火炮组在周围灌木丛中伪装起来，在远处不起作用；一队海军陆战队士兵在等待的时候，在处理一些小任务，互相交谈。“火力任务！火力任务！”无线电在第二炮台发出嘎嘎声。“火力任务！火力任务！”海军陆战队队员们齐声喊着，他们跳到任务上，放下了所有其他的东西。火炮组组长，预备役海军炮兵连P 5/14炮兵科科长亚历克斯・布利恩上士与无线电接线员聚在一起，接收炮兵连火力指挥中心关于射击次数、弹药类型、引信设置、充电强度、方位和高度的详细信息。酋长将方向转达给推搡的船员，在一个快速的动作中，炮位二的海军陆战队以良好的精度准备好了榴弹炮。飞兆半导体加强了美国海军陆战队P连：海军P连于2017年10月11日至14日开始了最新的演习，这是每年进行的四次实弹火炮演习之一，除了小武器射击和机关枪训练。这项最新的技能展示是他们在飞兆半导体空军基地的支持下致力于训练的直接结果。“在M777榴弹炮被用于该部队后不久，我们与飞兆半导体在过去五年中一直在为火炮提供服务，”安德鲁・J・米勒上尉说，斯波坎美国海军陆战队支援检查员讲师。“我们尽可能在基地维修火炮，因为他们有维修空间，需要用高架起重机将炮管从榴弹炮上吊起来进行高水平维修。这为我们节省了大量时间，也为我们节省了维护火炮所需的大量头痛。”这种支持之所以可能，是因为国防部提供了服务协议，允许不同的服务部门和盟军合作伙伴相互协助，节省资源、时间和金钱。“我们都属于国防部，作为一支军队，因此资金也来自一个地方，并根据需要分散。”负责计划和项目的92后勤准备中队士官詹姆斯・威廉姆斯中士说。“如果Fairchild能够支持我们的姐妹服务团队成员，我们会这样做。”P号电池距离海军基地很远，因此Fairchild填补了这一空白；通过医疗、继续教育、法律援助、礼拜堂服务甚至住房来支持他们。“我们与Fairchild有着健康的关系，”米勒说。“我们在这里没有任何分配或空间，因为我们驻扎的地方远离我们的其他地方，所以能为我们的部队和我们的使命提供支持真是太好了。”炮台P意味着业务：“Papa炮台是一个海军核心火炮单元，使用六门M777A2 155毫米轻型中型牵引榴弹炮，”米勒说。“他们的任务是向步兵地面部队的下射程提供火力支援，通常是预备役部队，但如果需要，可以为现役部队提供服务。”火炮连预计在部署时能够自给自足，米勒说，每一名海军陆战队成员都负责提供武器系统乘员和战斗机的多重角色，以处理任务、安全和运输。米勒说：“这些预备役海军陆战队成员非常熟练地操作这些武器系统。”。“他们的表现说明了他们对使命的奉献程度，以及他们个人的牺牲和成就。如果你认为他们一年只射击四次，而不是一个活跃的单位接受更多的时间训练，那么他们的能力是惊人的。”“在过去一年的训练中，P连已经安全、准确地发射了2000多枚155毫米炮弹，”P连5-14作战负责人、炮兵中士阿尔顿・库里（Alton Currie）说。“这是一次很好的演习。训练准备标准是我们的首要任务。”库里说。“一些海军陆战队已经承担起了新的炮位指挥官的更大责任，这对他们来说是必不可少的训练，他们将突破我们所有的装备，并与之一起为来年做好准备。”Semper Fidelis：枪膛打开；枪管清理干净，上油并准备好行动。装弹机将一枚100磅155毫米的弹丸挂在火炮上，并在将引信放在装弹滑道上之前让金条检查引信。两名海军陆战队士兵挥舞着一根长金属棒将弹药撞击到枪管中，添加推进剂装填；缺口关闭并关闭锁定。一名海军陆战队士兵宣布枪准备开火。布利恩举手警告：“准备开火！”在船员接到开火任务命令不到一分钟后，他发出警告。“开火！”布利恩以斩波动作命令射击。榴弹炮雷鸣般地鸣响：发射威力震动地面，使周围的泥土和灰尘飞入空中；冲击波撞击乘员，并在整个射击位置回响。“重新装填！”布利恩命令――射击过程重新开始。

“I feel fortunate that this past year, I had the opportunity to work at the region. Getting that exposure from a command perspective and that level of leadership is invaluable,” stated Bendavid. “By being a part of the RHC-P command team, I better understand what it means to lead and inspire, because I see it every day.”

When Bendavid left for basic training on Valentine’s Day in 2011, she was prepared for anything. Growing up she was always athletic and knew she was physically fit. She knew she was mentally fit and ready as well.

“I’m usually a safe person when making decisions in my life, but joining the Army, I didn’t hesitate at all.  After basic training I was assigned to Ft. Riley, in Kansas,” recalls Bendavid. “I just wanted to be a Soldier and wanted to join. I’m glad I did it. Within six months I was deployed to Afghanistan.”

During the nine months she spent in Afghanistan she was part of a female engagement team.

“I was part of a female engagement team, where our mission was to engage with the local female population in Afghanistan. Each company or unit selected female Soldiers to work alongside the Afghani Army and police to train females for the Afghani National Army,” recalls Bendavid. 

“The Afghanis didn’t have any females within their ranks, or a training program in place, so we came together to design a training regime which included Soldiering skills such as clearing a room, and doing searches.”
As a combat medic, Bendavid taught first aid and first responder skills.

“The opportunity I had in Afghanistan was so rewarding; to see all the females, eager, wanting to learn. They quickly picked up on everything we taught. It is still one of the most rewarding moments in my Army career.”

This next step of becoming an officer is consistent with her experience in Afghanistan and her life’s ambition to take on missions that benefit the greater good; actions that enhance not just one person’s life but also the lives of those she works with and serves alongside. She also knows that she will be in a position to lead and inspire others, giving other deserving Soldiers a chance to make their mark in the Army, serving their country.

“Soldiers are vital to the success and longevity of our organization.  Becoming an officer allows me the privilege of guiding Soldiers every day, and also provides me the opportunity to learn, develop and lead Soldiers across any spectrum,”  says Bendavid.

When the idea of joining the Army first entered Bendavid’s mind, she had no idea that her decision to enlist would take her to the places she has already been and opened the door to places she still can go. 

“Growing up first generation-American, in a single-parent home with five siblings gave me a unique outlook on life. I was not born into privilege. At a young age I was taught the significance of hard work and that nothing of importance in life was easy. Although delayed by different career paths, I stayed true to my initial aspiration of becoming a Soldier and enlisted into the Army.”

“It was not until I joined the military that I found a sense of purpose and I immediately realized that I had finally found my true calling,” she added.

Bendavid’s success is due in part to her solid support group and encouragement from her command team. 

“Brig. Gen. Bertram Providence planted a seed,” says Bendavid. “He told me 90 percent of the job is showing up, not just physically, but understanding the impact on everyone else and the future.”

Capt. Corey Lester, former Aide-de-Camp to the RHC-P commanding general, and Bendavid’s mentor, was also a driving force.  As a green to gold graduate, he was able to provide guidance as she navigated through her own process.

“As a Green to Gold graduate, I know what kind of Soldier it takes to succeed in the program,” said Lester. “After working with Sgt. Bendavid, it was obvious to me that she would be a competitive candidate.  I know she will be a future leader in the Army and make an impact on the future of the military.”

Bendavid holds fast to the teachings she gained as a child, that nothing of importance comes easy. As she prepares to take on the honorable responsibility of becoming a more influential leader, she goes in with the ultimate goal of positively impacting the lives of Soldiers and the Army.

“It was not until I joined the military that I found a sense of purpose and I immediately realized that I had finally found my true calling. I have surpassed my expectations of my career within the Army. When I first joined, I never thought I would be on the path to becoming an officer.”  

Even though she is not sure where she will end up after earning her degree, she is willing to go anywhere. She knows she has a strong network of support which is not only a big part of why she achieved gold, but she knows that network will still be there when she needs it.

244,Stories that Inspire- RHC-P Soldier finds gold,"Sgt. Mayra Bendavid, a combat medic assigned to Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P), struck gold recently.  She is one of the Army’s newest Green to Gold selectees.

As a Soldier and valued member of the RHC-P command team, her exposure to strategic level operations and engagements opened her eyes to a side of the Army she was not exposed to before. 

“I feel fortunate that this past year, I had the opportunity to work at the region. Getting that exposure from a command perspective and that level of leadership is invaluable,” stated Bendavid. “By being a part of the RHC-P command team, I better understand what it means to lead and inspire, because I see it every day.”

245,RHC-P leads facilitation of NIMS workshop at MEDCOM,"HONOLULU -- Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) carries on its tradition of excellence by being the first organization in the active Army to independently, without on-site assistance from the Center for the Army Profession and Ethics (CAPE) and Army Research Institute (ARI) to implement the Not in My Squad (NIMS) workshop.  

RHC-P’s regional program manager, Master Sgt. Kevin Edmondson also met another significant milestone recently.  He was the lead facilitator during the Army Medicine (AMEDD) level workshop. Edmondson, along with RHC-P facilitators, worked alongside Sgt. Maj. Wendell Mullen, AMEDD’s, SHARP program manager, who led the workshop. 

“When I first participated in the NIMS workshop in 2016, I had no idea it would grow into the accomplishment it has become for the region,” states Master Sgt. Kevin Edmondson, RHC-P’s SHARP program manager. “After assisting with the facilitation of a NIMS workshop for the 25th Infantry Division, myself and RHC-P’s leadership team saw the benefits of bringing the NIMS program to all direct reporting units in the region.” 

The mission of the NIMS workshop is to help junior NCOs assess the state of mutual trust and cohesion within their squads and teams as well as gain situational understanding in an effort to build and improve dignity, respect and inclusion. 

“The workshop allows NCOs an opportunity to talk about the challenges they face while building and maintaining a positive climate on their teams and squads,” explains Edmondson. 

Participants gathered from nearly every geographical location in the Army. In attendance at the workshop session that took place March 1-3, in San Antonio, Texas, were 28 NCOs in the rank of sergeant through sergeant first class, from several different military occupational specialties (MOS).

Edmondson’s team of RHC-P assigned facilitators included Master Sgt. Teresa Wilson-Mitchell, Sgt. 1st Class Kristen Stall, Staff Sgt. India Marquez, Staff Sgt. Dawn Irvine and Staff Sgt. Trisha Ronk. The team of facilitators was chosen because of their previous experience and participation with the NIMS workshop. 

During the three day workshop participants discuss topics ranging from the role of squad leaders in building unit climate, how leaders build and maintain positive unit climates and building an Army-wide culture of dignity, respect, inclusion and trust. NIMS participants also worked collaboratively to provide command level leadership feedback from the group discussions so they can impact change when and where feasible.

As Edmondson reflects on his role as the region’s program coordinator, he reflects on his personal goals as a Soldier.

“For years, growing up in the Army, I always heard and often said, if I ever get to a rank where I can influence change, I will,"" reflects Edmondson. “This workshop empowers the most junior NCOs to implement change. They no longer need to reach the rank of sergeant major or be a command sergeant major to do so. This is their opportunity to shape the Army, and Army Medicine, for years to come.”

Edmondson and his team will continue conducting the NIMS workshops around the region at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash. and Ft. Wainwright, Alaska in March and at Camp Zama, Japan and U.S. Army Garrison-Yongsan in June.",2017/3/10,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/226550/rhc-p-leads-facilitation-nims-workshop-medcom,"HONOLULU, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],檀香山，你好，美国,RHC-P领导在MEDCOM举办NIMS研讨会,檀香山――太平洋地区卫生司令部（RHC-P）继承了其卓越传统，成为现役陆军中第一个独立实施非我的小队（NIMS）研讨会的组织，无需陆军职业道德中心（CAPE）和陆军研究所（ARI）的现场协助。RHC-P的区域项目经理Kevin Edmondson上士最近也遇到了另一个重要里程碑。他是陆军医学（AMEDD）级研讨会的主要主持人。Edmondson与RHC-P协调员一起，与AMEDD的SHARP项目经理温德尔・马伦少校一起工作，后者领导了研讨会。RHC-P夏普项目经理凯文・埃德蒙森上士表示：“当我在2016年首次参加NIMS研讨会时，我不知道它会发展成为该地区的成就。”。“我和RHC-P的领导团队在协助为第25步兵师举办NIMS研讨会后，看到了将NIMS计划推广到该地区所有直接报告单位的好处。”NIMS研讨会的任务是帮助初级士官评估其团队和团队内的相互信任和凝聚力状态，并获得情境理解，以努力建立和改善尊严、尊重和包容。埃德蒙森解释说：“研讨会让士官们有机会谈论他们面临的挑战，同时为他们的团队和小队营造并保持积极的氛围。”。参与者几乎来自军队的每个地理位置。参加3月1日至3日在得克萨斯州圣安东尼奥举行的研讨会的有28名士官，从一等士官到一等士官，他们来自不同的军事职业专业（MOS）。埃德蒙森的RHC-P指定协调员团队包括特蕾莎・威尔逊・米切尔上士、克里斯汀・斯泰尔一等士官，印度马奎斯上士、道恩欧文上士和特里沙・朗克上士。推动者小组的选择是因为他们以前的经验和参与NIMS研讨会。在为期三天的研讨会中，学员们讨论了从班长在营造部队氛围中的作用、领导如何营造和保持积极的部队氛围，以及在全军范围内营造尊严、尊重、包容和信任的文化等话题。NIMS参与者还合作提供来自小组讨论的指挥级领导反馈，以便他们能够在可行的时间和地点影响变革。当埃德蒙森反思他作为该地区项目协调员的角色时，他反思了他作为士兵的个人目标。埃德蒙森反映道：“多年来，在军队长大，我总是听到并经常说，如果我能成为一名能够影响变革的人，我会的。”。“这个研讨会授权最初级的士官实施变革。他们不再需要达到军士长军衔或成为指挥军士长才能实现变革。这是他们在未来几年塑造军队和军队医学的机会。”埃德蒙森和他的团队将于3月在华盛顿州刘易斯・麦考德联合基地和阿拉斯加温赖特堡，以及6月在日本扎马营地和美国陆军驻军永山继续在该地区举办NIMS研讨会。
246,RHC-P’s Inspector General provides objective guidance,"HONOLULU C For nearly 231 years the Army’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has served commanders through its dedicated practice of investigating and providing guidance to Soldiers and civilians so they stand ready to complete their missions.  

As the new year begins, Regional Health Command-Pacific, also known as RHC-P’s, OIG continues with the mission of providing objective and impartial support to RHC-P’s active-duty and civilian staff with clarification and guidance on commonly misunderstood Army regulations, policies, procedures and best practices. 

“We build on the enduring excellence of the inspector general system and extend the RHC-P commander's eyes, ears, voice and conscience to create a more credible, reliable and knowledgeable organization, with a reputation for providing confidential and accurate assistance to Soldiers, family members, civilian staff and patients,” states Lt. Col. Vernon Wheeler, RHC-P command inspector general. “We thoroughly embrace and display the core Army values; teach and train Soldiers and adaptive leaders.”

As one of the commander’s representatives, the OIG resolves issues as the directing authority to deciding allegations of impropriety. The OIG investigates violations of policy, regulation or law, mismanagement, unethical behavior, fraud and misconduct. The office also provides a safe environment for employees to seek assistance. The OIG works to educate all involved parties and ensures concerns are resolved at the lowest level possible, facilitating complicated or confusing guidance and procedures but always following regional, Army Medicine and Army regulations, policies and procedures.

“We identify systemic trends and issues throughout RHC-P, Army Medicine and the Army,” says Wheeler. “Then we work to develop and assist with the implementation of solutions to emerging trends in support of organizational success.  The OIG is responsible for inquiring and reporting on the discipline, efficiency, economy, morale, training and readiness within Army units,” added Wheeler.

The OIG is always available for assistance, but first and foremost, those seeking assistance should use the resources available at their unit or office, giving those responsible an opportunity to assist in resolving concerns.  For example, employees with grievances can first use their chain of command to address issues. If personnel feel they are not being properly supported, the OIG may be able to assist, or know someone who can.

No matter where assistance is sought, confidentiality will be maintained as best as possible. The OIG does not make recommendations on punishments or adverse actions. This allows them to remain neutral and impartial while fact finding, supporting the policy and regulatory guidance in place.

RHC-P’s OIG has office locations at Tripler Army Medical Center and Madigan Army Medical Center in order to support the larger populations at those facilities.  If employees are not located at one of those centers they can seek assistance at one of the regional offices in Hawaii or Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. However, anyone can submit a complaint, allegation or request for information or assistance to any Army OIG worldwide.

247,213th Regional Support Group attends FIT-P+,"Story by Staff Sgt. Lorene Mauro

FORT INDIANTOWN GAP, Pa. C Fifty five Soldiers from the 213th Regional Support Group joined other Pennsylvania Army National Guard units in attending the fourth iteration of the new Fitness Improvement Training Program Plus here August 6-20.

Soldiers from the 213th Regional Support Group, 28th Combat Aviation Brigade, the 28th Infantry Division Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion and 55th Armor Brigade Combat Team attended and served as cadre for this iteration. 

FIT-P+ is a commander recommended 148 hour course.  During the 15 day course, participants attend classes and training events geared towards a healthier lifestyle, resiliency, and reinforcing the Warrior Ethos and Army core competencies, said Sgt. 1st Class Jon Gibbons, the Individual Training Branch noncommissioned officer-in-charge. 

The course is designed to employ the Army’s total Soldier concept, he said. Soldiers attend nutritional counseling and fitness classes as well as practicing Soldier skills such as marksmanship, land navigation, combatives and other individual common tasks, Gibbons continued.

Sgt. Donald J. MacKenzie, a flight medic with Foxtrot Company 1/169th Aviation Battalion, 28th Combat Aviation Brigade, 28th Infantry Division and a medic during this iteration said there is definitely an exercise component of the course, but it’s also a lot more than that.

“I think they do a good job of getting away from just the [physical fitness] part of it,” said MacKenzie.

Spc. Allan J. Hopperstead, a health care specialist from the 28th Military Police Company, 728th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, 213th Regional Support Group and a medic for FIT-P+ said he was impressed with the classes given during the program. 

“The nutrition classes really inform and help really break down plans to support fitness goals and maintain an overall healthier lifestyle,” said Hopperstead.

Spc. Drew M. Workman, an information systems specialist from the Headquarters and Headquarters Company 728th Combat Sustainment Support Battalion, 213th Regional Support Group and a participant in the program, said he enjoyed attending the program.

“They should make this an [annual training] for everyone,” said Workman. “It’s awesome. It feels like I’m in the Army; it was fun shooting, ruck marching and doing land [navigation],” he said.

The Soldiers were weighed, taped if needed, and given a diagnostic Army Physical Fitness Test at the beginning and end of the program.

The 213th Regional Support Group Soldiers lost a total of 390 and altogether the 106 Soldiers that participated in this iteration lost 727 pounds; that’s about 7 pounds per Soldier, said Gibbons. APFT scores went up by about 38 points on average, he added.

248,Hickam CDDAR team raises P-3 Orion,"KALAELOA, Hawaii - Airmen from the Hawaii Air National Guard 154th Maintenance Squadron (MXS), and active duty 15th MXS successfully completed a lift of a P-3 Orion Aircraft Jan. 27 at Kalaeloa Airport. 

Lifting of the P-3 was part of an annual training exercise for Hickam’s Crash, Damaged, Disabled Aircraft, Recovery (CDDAR) team. 

“It [CDDAR] is a team of highly trained and specialized maintainers who work to quickly remove and recover a disabled aircraft with the goal of minimizing additional damage,” said Maj. Brian S. Mix, 15th MXS commander. “By doing so we can re-open the airbase or airport as quickly as possible while hopefully maintaining the aircraft in such a condition that it can be fully repaired and returned to service.”

Once investigative and safety operations have been completed, the CDDAR team utilizes a wide range of techniques and equipment to safely remove a disabled aircraft. 

“The team's capabilities cover the full spectrum of incident responses from simply towing an aircraft out of the dirt to lifting it off the ground with specialized air bags and cranes,” said Mix. 

Lifting the P-3 required close coordination and constant communication between the personnel operating five separate lift bag stations and six tethering positions. The exercise provided an opportunity for both initial and recurrent training as well as the inspection of CDDAR equipment.

“The P-3 lift included challenges such as multiple lift stations, wing angle, weight and balance, and multiple team coordination,” said Chief Master Sgt. Edward Essman, 154th MXS Aircraft Maintenance manager. “Assigned team chiefs for the training had to safely coordinate the stations to evenly lift the P-3 to a working height that would allow a successful recovery.”

According to Essman, no one lift or recovery operation is the same; each situation requires a tailored approach. 

“Every scenario is different so what type of aircraft, where the incident occurred and what type of incident happened would factor into our response posture,” said Essman. “In most instances, we would be responding with the crash investigators and help them preserve any evidence to be used in their investigation.”

In addition to guard and active duty airmen, exercise participants included Army, Coast Guard and civilian personnel.

“Total force integration enjoyed here is important,” said Essman. “We enjoy working and training with multiple services and are able to share lessons learned and improve response capability by building off each other's knowledge.”

According to Essman, Hickam’s CDDAR team has been called to respond to a few real world instances. In each of those cases, training such as January’s P-3 lift has proven invaluable. 

“Few functions require more precise individual and team actions, yet are provided even fewer occasions in which the individual and team can become proficient through actual hands on experience,” said Essman.

249,Mongolian Chief Medical Officer visits the RHC-P,"HONOLULU - The Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) recently had the pleasure of having Lt. Col. Ganchimeg Lkhagvasuren, Chief Medical Officer for the Mongolian Armed Forces, visit the Oahu based RHC-P Military Health Readiness Platforms, Dec. 14-17, 2015. 

Lkhagvasuren’s visit continues the RHC-P's focus on medical diplomacy throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific area of responsibility; sharing medical technologies, approaches, and best practices for the betterment of health throughout the region. 

The Mongolian military has a rich tradition of female Soldiers serving in leadership positions. During ancient times Genghis Khan appointed his daughters as Army Combat Generals and some women were Mongol city commanders.

In today's Mongolian Military Force, which averages around 25,000 Service Members, there are only 20 female officers who are at the rank of Lt. Col; none higher.

Lkhagvasuren will soon break that barrier, as she has been selected to be promoted to the rank of Colonel in the very near future; which will make her the highest ranking female officer in the Mongolian Armed Forces. 

During her visit to the RHC-P Headquarters, Lkhagvasuren met with RHC-P's Command Team, Brig General Patrick Sargent and Command Sgt. Maj. Robert Luciano, and she was able to ascertain RHC-P's approach to Access to Care and Army Medicine's philosophy of providing High Reliability Healthcare. 

She also had the opportunity to learn about the operational aspect of managing Army Medicine's largest region and she visited RHC-P's largest Health Readiness Platform, Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), where she saw how world class healthcare is provided on a large scale, as well as how a teaching hospital develops young healthcare providers into seasoned professionals.

Lkhagvasuren also met with RHC-P's Veteran Affairs partners here on Oahu, the VA Pacific Islands Healthcare System, where she and the VA staff discussed the differences and similarities between providing healthcare to the veterans of Mongolia and the United States. 

Lkhagvasuren took the opportunity during her time at TAMC to provide a presentation to the staff on the ""Healthcare in the Mongolian Military Medical System"". Those in attendance had the chance to see the challenges faced and approaches taken by Lkhagvasuren, and her team, as they provide healthcare to Mongolian force.

Perhaps one of the most interesting stops on her tour was Lkhagvasuren’s visit to the Fisher House - Tripler Army Medical Center. 

There, Lkhagvasuren seemed to thoroughly enjoy learning about Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher and their dedication to the Service Men and Women of the United States Armed Forces, as well as seeing how we use the Fisher House to support patients and family members who need a place to stay during periods of hospitalization and recovery, and she really enjoyed meeting the guests and experiencing the ""Aloha Spirit"" that only the Fisher House here in Hawaii can provide. 

Lkhagvasuren completed her week with a tour of the United States Army Health Clinic-Schofield Barracks (USAHC-SB) and the Warrior Transition Battalion-Hawaii, where she saw how Army Medicine directly impacts the War Fighter and their families. 

All-in-all, the week that Lkhagvasuren toured the RHC-P footprint was a great success in the continued efforts of building & strengthening professional medical relationships with the partner nations within the Pacific region. She was able to share as much about her healthcare system, as she obtained about the RHC-P's system for health.

Perhaps on her next visit, she can share how what she learned here, helped her develop the healthcare provided to the Mongolian Armed Forces.",2015/12/18,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/184939/mongolian-chief-medical-officer-visits-rhc-p,"HONOLULU, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],檀香山，你好，美国,蒙古首席医疗官访问RHC-P,檀香山-太平洋地区卫生司令部（RHC-P）最近有幸邀请蒙古武装部队首席医疗官甘吉梅格・勒哈格瓦苏伦中校于2015年12月14日至17日参观了位于瓦胡岛的RHC-P军事卫生准备平台。Lkhagvasuren的访问继续了RHC-P对整个印度-亚太责任区医疗外交的关注；分享医疗技术、方法和最佳实践，以改善整个地区的健康状况。蒙古军队有着女性士兵担任领导职务的丰富传统。在古代，成吉思汗任命他的女儿为陆军作战将领，一些妇女担任蒙古城市指挥官。在今天平均约25000名服役人员的蒙古军队中，只有20名女军官担任中校军衔；没有比这更高的了。哈格瓦苏伦很快就会打破这一障碍，因为她已被选中在不久的将来晋升为上校；这将使她成为蒙古武装部队中级别最高的女军官。在访问RHC-P总部期间，Lkhagvasuren会见了RHC-P的指挥团队Patrick Sargent准将和指挥中士Robert Luciano少校，她能够确定RHC-P获得护理的方法和陆军医学提供高可靠性医疗的理念。她还有机会了解了管理陆军医学最大区域的运作方面，并参观了RHC-P最大的健康准备平台Tripler陆军医学中心（TAMC），在那里她看到了如何大规模提供世界一流的医疗服务，以及教学医院如何将年轻的医疗保健提供者培养成经验丰富的专业人员。Lkhagvasuren还与RHC-P的资深事务合作伙伴在瓦胡岛（弗吉尼亚州太平洋岛屿医疗系统）会面，在那里，她和退伍军人协会的工作人员讨论了为蒙古和美国退伍军人提供医疗服务的异同。Lkhagvasuren在TAMC期间利用这个机会向工作人员介绍了“蒙古军事医疗系统中的医疗保健”。与会者有机会看到Lkhagvasuren及其团队在为蒙古军队提供医疗保健服务时所面临的挑战和采取的方法。Lkhagvasuren此行最有趣的一站可能是参观Fisher House-Tripler陆军医疗中心。在那里，Lkhagvasuren似乎非常喜欢了解Zachary和Elizabeth Fisher以及他们对美国武装部队男女军人的奉献精神，也很喜欢看到我们如何利用Fisher House来支持住院和康复期间需要住宿的患者和家庭成员，她真的很喜欢会见客人，体验“阿罗哈精神”，只有夏威夷的费舍尔之家才能提供这种精神。Lkhagvasuren结束了她的一周，参观了美国陆军健康诊所Schofield Barracks（USAHC-SB）和夏威夷勇士过渡营，在那里她看到了陆军医学如何直接影响战士及其家人。总而言之，Lkhagvasuren参观RHC-P足迹的那一周是与太平洋地区伙伴国家建立和加强专业医疗关系的持续努力的一个巨大成功。她能够分享关于她的医疗系统的信息，就像她获得的关于RHC-P的医疗系统的信息一样。也许在下次访问中，她可以分享她在这里学到的知识，帮助她发展向蒙古武装部队提供的医疗保健。
250,Vanguard Brigade first to equip with JBC-P upgrade,"FORT STEWART, Ga. C The 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, or the Vanguard Brigade, of 3rd Infantry Division, is the first unit in the Army to be fielded the new Joint Battle Command-Platform, or JBC-P.

“It's primarily a situational awareness system,” said Col. Michael Thurston, the project manager of Mission Command with the Army’s Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Tactical. “The display shows a map of the area you're operating in, very much like a GPS.”

Thurston said JBC-P, which is a software upgrade to current tracking systems, can display friendly forces, opposing forces, obstacle information and graphics as well as mission essential information. All information can flow two ways from individual vehicles to higher and lower commands, and back down again. Thurston added it also builds on the command systems already in place.

The Vanguard Brigade was chosen as the first unit in the Army to field their vehicles and tactical operation centers with the upgraded software based on a few criteria, but the brigade commander, Col. Thomas Gukeisen, helped the brigade live up to their motto, “Out Front.”

“[Gukeisen] had seen the capability and he lobbied to get it into this unit because he wanted to be the first one to have it in the Army,” said Thurston.

“When you look at technology in the military, it's either evolutionary or revolutionary, and seeing what this can do, it's revolutionary,” said Gukeisen. “I saw this capability, so I asked if we could be the first unit equipped. I said I would love to have this system.”

Gukeisen's request was granted and the JBC-P fielding and training started early January and is scheduled to be complete by March this year. Pfc. Dajuan Gibson, a system support specialist with Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 4th IBCT, attended the operator course, as well as the maintainer course, which has enabled him to teach others.

“I think it'll benefit us because it's easier to teach,” said Gibson. “I could get people in an area and show them how to use it in a matter of minutes.”

Gibson noted the system is similar in some respects to the current systems, but the upgrade provides a more streamlined user-friendly interface.

“It has a little circle that has all different kinds of icons, and you just click on what you need,” Gibson said. “Everything is right there instead of having to look in different places.” 

Thurston visited the Vanguard Brigade, Jan. 21, during the beginning of a three-month brigade level exercise, Vanguard Focus, to assess how the fielding and training on the new system was progressing to help improve the program.

Thurston said the brigade’s training schedule allowed his team to see how the system is being used right away, unlike sometimes when new systems may be stored away until training is planned. “We get a lot of great feedback,” he added.

Gukeisen said the Vanguard Brigade will continue to give feedback on JBC-P during Vanguard Focus and beyond, such as during the brigade's scheduled summer rotation at the Joint Readiness Training Center, in Fort Polk, Louisiana.

“I think it's the future, I don't even think we've fully explored it, and that's the job of the first unit equipped, is to explore it,” said Gukeisen. “Now we're putting it through its full rigors.”
 
“From our perspective,” Thurston said, “we've got a great unit here with 4/3 ID that's fully embraced the new equipment fielding.”",2015/1/22,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/152710/vanguard-brigade-first-equip-with-jbc-p-upgrade,"FORT STEWART, GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佐治亚州斯图尔特堡,先锋旅首次装备JBC-P升级版,斯图尔特堡，佐治亚州――第三步兵师的第四步兵旅战斗队或先锋旅是陆军中第一个部署新联合作战指挥平台（JBC-P）的部队。“它主要是一个态势感知系统，”迈克尔・瑟斯顿上校说，陆军项目执行办公室的任务指挥部项目经理，负责指挥、控制和战术通信。Thurston说，JBC-P是对现有跟踪系统的软件升级，可以显示友军、敌军、障碍物信息和图形以及任务基本信息。所有信息可以通过两种方式从单个车辆流向上级和下级命令，然后再返回。瑟斯顿补充说，它还建立在现有指挥系统的基础上。先锋旅被选为陆军中第一个使用基于一些标准的升级软件部署车辆和战术作战中心的部队，但旅指挥官托马斯・古凯森上校帮助该旅实现了他们的座右铭“前线”瑟斯顿说：“[古凯森]已经看到了这种能力，他游说将其加入这支部队，因为他想成为第一个在军队中拥有这种能力的人。古凯森说：“当你观察军队中的技术时，它要么是进化的，要么是革命性的，看看它能做什么，它就是革命性的。”。“我看到了这种能力，所以我问我们是否可以成为第一个装备这种系统的单位。我说我很想拥有这种系统。”Gukeisen的请求得到了批准，JBC-P的部署和训练于1月初开始，计划于今年3月完成。总部和第四IBCT总部公司的系统支持专家Pfc.Dajuan Gibson参加了操作员课程和维护人员课程，这使他能够教授其他人。吉布森说：“我认为这将使我们受益，因为它更容易教学。我可以让人们在一个地区，并在几分钟内告诉他们如何使用它。”吉布森指出，该系统在某些方面与当前的系统相似，但升级提供了更精简的用户友好界面。吉布森说：“它有一个小圆圈，上面有各种各样的图标，你只需点击你需要的东西，一切都在那里，而不必看不同的地方。”1月21日，在为期三个月的旅级演习“先锋焦点”开始期间，瑟斯顿访问了先锋旅，以评估新系统的部署和训练进展如何，以帮助改进该计划。瑟斯顿说，该旅的训练日程安排使他的团队能够立即了解该系统的使用情况，而不是有时，新系统可能会被储存起来，直到训练计划完成。“我们得到了很多很好的反馈，”他补充道。古凯森说，先锋旅将在先锋集中训练期间和以后继续对JBC-P提供反馈，例如在该旅计划在路易斯安那州波尔克堡联合战备训练中心的夏季轮换期间。古凯森说：“我认为这是未来，我甚至不认为我们已经对它进行了充分的探索，而装备的第一支部队的工作就是探索它。现在我们正在对它进行全面的测试。”“从我们的角度来看，”瑟斯顿说，“我们这里有一支拥有4/3 ID的伟大部队，它完全接受了新装备的部署。”
251,P-S GAR participates in first National Police Week,"PETERSON AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. C National Police Week is a time set aside to honor the men and women of law enforcement at the local, state and federal level. This is also a time to remember officers who have given their lives in the line of duty.  

In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed Public Law 87-726 designating May 15 as Peace Officers' Memorial Day. May 10 through May 15, 2021, is designated as National Police Week.

Although the holiday has been celebrated throughout the Department of Defense for 59 years, this year marked the newly formed Peterson-Schriever Garrison’s first opportunity to participate in National Police Week, with the 21st Security Forces Squadron, 50th Security Forces Squadron, and Office of Special Investigation Detachments 803 and 807 participating together in morale and remembrance events.

“Our unit, along with the other Front Range security forces units, held several activities throughout the week to pay special recognition to law enforcement officers, OSI agents and SF members who have made the supreme sacrifices in the line of duty for the safety and protection of others,” said Tim Omdal, 21st SFS deputy director. “Each of the activities during the past week allowed us to honor the fallen officers and renew our solemn vow to never forget their sacrifices and the families they left behind.”

The week’s events included a shooting competition at Schriever Air Force Base; an obstacle course at the U.S. Air Force Academy; and a police exposition, a golf tournament, and flag football at Peterson AFB.

“At the end of the day our desired outcome is to come together as one,” said Senior Airman Roderick Silvers, 21st SFS investigator. “It’s good to take a break and enjoy the time spent together in a safe environment, share some stories, make new friends and of course build some comradery with a few competitions to take home some hardware and bragging rights!”",2021/5/10,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/398957/p-s-gar-participates-first-national-police-week,"COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国科罗拉多州斯普林斯,P-S GAR参加第一个国家警察周,科罗拉多州彼得森空军基地――国家警察周是专门用来纪念地方、州和联邦各级执法人员的时间。这也是一个纪念为执行任务而献出生命的军官的时刻。1962年，约翰・肯尼迪总统签署了第87-726号公法，将5月15日定为和平官员阵亡将士纪念日。2021年5月10日至5月15日被指定为国家警察周。尽管国防部59年来一直在庆祝这个节日，但今年是新组建的彼得森・施里弗驻军首次有机会参加国家警察周，第21安全部队中队，第50安全部队中队和特别调查分队办公室803和807一起参加士气和纪念活动。“我们的部队和其他前线安全部队部队在一周内举行了几次活动，以特别表彰执法人员、现场视察人员和SF成员，他们在履行职责时为他人的安全和保护做出了最大牺牲，”第21届SFS副总监Tim Omdal说。“过去一周的每一次活动都让我们能够向牺牲的军官致敬，并重申我们的庄严誓言，永远不会忘记他们的牺牲和他们留下的家人。”本周的活动包括施里弗空军基地的射击比赛；美国空军学院的障碍训练场；彼得森空军基地的警察博览会、高尔夫比赛和旗子足球。“最终，我们期望的结果是团结一致，”第21届SFS调查员、高级飞行员罗德里克・西尔弗斯（Roderick Silvers）说。“休息一下，在一个安全的环境中享受在一起的时光，分享一些故事，结交新朋友，当然，通过几场比赛建立一些同志关系，带回家一些硬件和吹牛的权利，这很好！”
252,HRMC docks USS William P. Lawrence for maintenance availability,"PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii C Hawaii Regional Maintenance Center (HRMC) docked Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS William P. Lawrence (DDG 110) March 9, completing one of the first major milestones in the ship’s docking selected restricted availability (DSRA).

This will be the second time HRMC has partnered with Vigor Marine, LLC to complete a surface ship DSRA at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard & Intermediate Maintenance Facility (PHNSY & IMF).

“We are thrilled to get underway with William P. Lawrence’s availability and look forward to a successful partnership with ship’s force and Vigor Marine,” said Capt. Daniel Kidd, HRMC Deputy Commander. “The work the team will complete during this scheduled maintenance period will help maintain and modernize this mighty warship so that she can get back to sea executing the Navy’s mission.”

DSRAs are routine maintenance availabilities planned in advance allowing the ship to receive necessary repairs, maintenance and modernization to ensure it operates at full technical capacity and mission capability for its entire designed service life. The ship will also receive a major combat systems installation to provide critical upgrades to its communication capabilities. In all, the planned work is expected to require more than 50,000 man-days to complete.

“We all have a sense of excitement as we begin the availability knowing our work directly impacts the Navy’s mission,” said HRMC William P. Lawrence Project Manager J.C. ""Harry"" Herrera. “The HRMC and Vigor team is laser-focused on executing first-time quality work that will return the ship back to sea on time for her crew.”

This DSRA marks the first time PHNSY & IMF docked a berthing and messing barge alongside a ship in Dry Dock 4. The barge provides working and living spaces for the ship’s crew when services such as berthing, climate control, food service, and water supply are not available on board during the availability. Due to scheduled repairs on the pier adjoining the dry dock, the barge could not be moored in its usual berth. Seeking an innovative solution, the shipyard docking team and HRMC determined docking the barge would allow the crew to have quick access to the ship throughout the availability.

The expected cost of William P. Lawrence’s DSRA is approximately $90 million, accounting for a part of the estimated $250 million in surface ship maintenance contracting executed throughout fiscal years 2020 and 2021 by PHNSY & IMF. With a combined civilian and military workforce of approximately 6,500 along with 700 contractors, the shipyard has an annual economic impact of $1 billion.

PHNSY & IMF is a field activity of Naval Sea Systems Command and a one-stop regional maintenance center for the Navy’s surface ships and submarines. It is the largest industrial employer in the state of Hawaii. It is the most comprehensive fleet repair and maintenance facility between the U.S. West Coast and the Far East, strategically located in the heart of the Pacific, being about a week’s steaming time closer to potential regional contingencies in the Indo-Pacific.

253,P-S GAR safety conducts confined spaces training,"The Peterson-Schriever Garrison safety office led a confined spaces training in collaboration with the 21st Medical Squadron bioenvironmental flight and the Schriever Fire Department Sept. 24 at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado, to ensure the 50th Space Communications Squadron members could execute their duty requirements.

According to the P-S GAR safety office, a confined space is an area with a limited means of getting in and out, is not meant for consistent work and is just large enough to enter. This particular training was conducted at a manhole on base.

Some of the hazards of entering confined spaces on base include oxygen deficiencies, encounters with wild life and exposure to vehicle exhaust.

“Sometimes we get complacent to hazards associated with our jobs because we do it every day,” said Tech. Sgt. Christopher Boze, P-S GAR occupational safety manager. “By doing this training, it’s a refresher for the units involved and can ultimately help bring the workers home at the end of the day.”

Without the training event, bioenvironmental and the fire department would be required to be in attendance at every entry into a confined space. The 50th SCS is planning on entering every manhole with communications lines running beneath them within the next year.

“We’re there to ensure [those going in the confined spaces are] following [Occupational Safety and Health Administration] and Air Force Standards,” said Master Sgt.

254,P-S GAR gains new space intelligence squadrons,"The U.S. Space Force activated the 71st and 72nd Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance Squadrons Sept. 11, 2020, at Peterson-Schriever Garrison, Colorado.

The squadrons, which fall under Space Delta 7, made history as one of the first space intelligence squadrons activated in the USSF.

“The realignment of intelligence forces under the U.S. Space Force represents a generational opportunity to re-think the way we apply intelligence support to operations both in space and other supported domains,” said Senior Master Sgt. Justin Michaels, 71st ISRS superintendent. “It represents a chance for us to approach mission requirements in innovative ways that allows us to better understand the threat environment and ensure the safety and protection of our forces.”

Maj. Michael Harter, 71st ISRS commander, said the squadron presents intelligence support to all the Space Mission Deltas across the USSF. The unit provides intelligence professionals from six geographically separated detachments to work directly with space operators.

“We provide operational intelligence on adversary actions and reactions so space operators can best posture themselves to accomplish their mission,” Harter said.

Also operating on Peterson, with three geographically separated detachments, the 72nd ISRS provides tactically focused intelligence analysis, exploitation and reporting for the joint warfighter.

“We know the adversary is actively using space to do subversive and dangerous things,” said Maj. Kimberly Templer, 72nd ISRS commander.

One of the primary advantages of the ISR squadrons within the USSF, directly under Space ISR Delta 7, is the dissemination and utilization of operational intelligence in an expeditious, timely and efficient manner. 

Depending on the missions of the specific detachments, the units work on a 24/7 schedule. “It’s important for us to be aware of what we’re doing across Delta 7, because we all have a piece of the puzzle and to be able to put those pieces together is huge,” Templer said. “Even though the ISR squadrons and detachments are in different pockets of the space domain, it’s a symbiotic relationship.”

Operations in the space domain not only impact the military, but also have significant economic and communications implications for the global population, said Senior Master Sgt. Caleb Lloyd, 72nd ISRS superintendent.

“The American way of life is heavily reliant on the capabilities and assets the Space Force provides,” Lloyd said. “It’s our job to identify threats and understand adversary capabilities and intent so we can provide sound assessments to our senior leaders [so they can] make time-critical decisions on how we protect and defend.”",2020/9/18,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/379470/p-s-gar-gains-new-space-intelligence-squadrons,"SCHRIEVER AIR FORCE BASE, COLORADO, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国科罗拉多州施里弗空军基地,P-S GAR获得新的空间情报中队,美国航天部队于2020年9月11日在科罗拉多州彼得森・施里弗（Peterson Schriever）加里森（Garrison）启动了第71和72情报监视和侦察中队。该中队隶属于太空三角洲7号（Space Delta 7），是美国空军首批启动的太空情报中队之一，创造了历史。第71届ISRS总监贾斯汀・迈克尔斯（Justin Michaels）高级军士长说：“美国航天部队的情报力量重组代表了一次新的机会，让我们重新思考如何将情报支持应用于太空和其他支持领域的行动。”。“这为我们提供了一个以创新方式处理任务要求的机会，使我们能够更好地了解威胁环境，确保我们部队的安全和保护。”第71任ISRS指挥官迈克尔・哈特少校说，该中队向整个USSF的所有空间任务三角洲提供情报支持。该部队提供来自六个地理位置不同的分遣队的情报专业人员，直接与空间操作员合作。“我们提供有关敌方行动和反应的作战情报，以便空间运营商能够以最佳姿态完成任务。”第72 ISRS也在彼得森作战，拥有三个地理位置不同的分遣队，为联合作战人员提供以战术为重点的情报分析、利用和报告。“我们知道对手正在积极利用太空进行颠覆和危险活动。”第72任ISR指挥官金伯利・坦普尔少校说。USSF内直接隶属于空间ISR Delta 7的ISR中队的主要优势之一是以快速、及时和高效的方式传播和利用作战情报。根据具体分遣队的任务，这些分队按24/7计划工作邓普勒说：“对我们来说，意识到我们在德尔塔7上所做的事情很重要，因为我们都有一块拼图，能够把这些拼图拼在一起是巨大的。即使ISR中队和分遣队位于太空领域的不同区域，这也是一种共生关系。”“太空领域的行动不仅影响军事，而且对全球人口具有重大的经济和通信影响，”高级少校、第72届ISRS总监Caleb Lloyd说。“美国的生活方式严重依赖于太空部队提供的能力和资产，”Lloyd说。“我们的工作是识别威胁，了解对手的能力和意图，以便我们能够向我们的高级领导提供合理的评估[以便他们]就我们如何保护和防御做出时间关键的决定。”
255,P-S GAR preps for fiscal year close out,"SCHRIEVER AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. C The Peterson-Schriever Garrison ramps up its activity as it aims to fulfill projects across both bases as the fiscal year closes Sept. 30.

During the fiscal year, which began from Oct. 1, the 21st Comptroller Squadron and 50th Contracting Squadron provide units funds to finance their missions.  

Throughout the close-out process, it’s important Airmen maintain good communication to fulfill projects. The close out includes multiple units and they must coordinate to ensure mission success.

“That necessary communication needs to occur between not only members of the squadron, but also between us and our teammates around this location and [U.S. Space Force Headquarters],” said Capt. Jeremy Lacewell, 21st CPTS director of operations.   

This connection includes the 50th CONS, which manages the government purchase card program and writes contracts to fulfill funding.   

Without the preparation from the mission partners, budget office and the contracting office, Staff Sgt. Arron Riffle, 50th CONS contracting officer, said the fiscal year close out wouldn’t be as successful.  

“The end of the fiscal year is about ensuring the appropriated funds are obligated before they expire [at midnight Sept. 30],” Riffle said. “All of that [work] is meaningless unless we are providing the supplies and services that the units need to be successful in their objectives.” 

The CPTS currently has 85 projects and requirements it plans to fund and Master Sgt. Wilfredo Mateo, 21st CPTS Financial Analysis flight chief, said that number could change.  

“Our local list of unfunded items and projects ebbs and flows as we work the numbers and packages with 50 CONS,” Mateo said.  

The 21st CPTS also provides financial support to mission partners. Earlier this year, the squadron helped U.S. Space Command complete a $25 million building lease agreement in addition to their required projects.

“This was certainly the largest dollar figure we’ve certified all year,” Mateo said. “We also helped USSPACECOM execute a $2 million project for their new office in [Washington] D.C., to give them a dedicated space as a combatant command.” 

The CPTS will also fund $387,000 to help remodel the Schriever AFB education center before the end of this year.  

“This will allow promotion testing on site versus having our members driving to the Peterson testing center,” Mateo said. “They’ll also be able to provide other testing services and have a dedicated classroom to conduct professional seminars and various courses. This is a huge quality of life improvement for our Airmen.” 

Lacewell hopes the final month of the fiscal year serves as a learning experience for younger Airmen. Rather than the period being stressful, Airmen can gather information from someone such as Lacewell, who is completing his fourth close out.  

“Airmen should ask as many questions as they can, but also sit with someone who is actively in that process and watch how he or she works through the different systems,” Lacewell said. “In a way, [close-outs] get easier with time because you start to understand what to look for around this time of the year.” 

Mateo also ensures Airmen are informed of their significance during the process and highlights how their duties affect the garrison. 

“Our Airmen work too hard to be limited by aging equipment, dilapidated work areas and concerns about their paycheck being correct,” Mateo said. “It takes a team of people to manage all the intricacies of accounting and budget for the base. Without us, I don’t think we’d be able to execute taxpayer dollars across our various mission sets and sustain our way of life.”",2020/9/11,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/378734/p-s-gar-preps-fiscal-year-close-out,"COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国科罗拉多州斯普林斯,P-S GAR为财年结束做准备,科罗拉多州施里弗空军基地――彼得森・施里弗驻军计划在9月30日财政年度结束时完成两个基地的项目。在10月1日开始的财政年度中，第21个主计长中队和第50个合同中队向部队提供资金，以资助其任务。在整个收尾过程中，飞行员保持良好的沟通以完成项目非常重要。收尾包括多个单位，他们必须协调以确保任务成功。“不仅中队成员之间需要进行必要的沟通，而且我们和我们在该地点周围的队友以及（美国航天部队总部）之间也需要进行必要的沟通，”第21届CPTS行动总监杰里米・拉斯韦尔上尉说。这种联系包括第50个CONS，它管理政府购买卡计划，并编写合同来履行资金。如果没有特派团合作伙伴、预算办公室和合同办公室的准备，第50届CONS合同官员参谋中士阿伦・里夫勒（Arron Riffle）表示，财政年度的收尾不会如此成功。Riffle说：“财政年度的结束是为了确保拨款在（9月30日午夜）到期之前履行义务。”。“除非我们提供部队成功实现目标所需的物资和服务，否则所有这些（工作）都是毫无意义的。”CPTS目前计划资助85个项目和要求，并掌握中士。第21届CPTS财务分析飞行负责人威尔弗雷多・马特奥（Wilfredo Mateo）表示，这一数字可能会发生变化。马蒂奥说：“我们当地没有资金的项目和项目清单随着我们与50名反对者一起计算数量和方案而起伏。”。第21个国家方案工作队还向特派团伙伴提供财政支助。今年早些时候，该中队帮助美国航天司令部完成了一项2500万美元的建筑租赁协议，以及他们所需的项目。马特奥说：“这肯定是我们全年所确认的最大金额。”。“我们还帮助USSPACECOM为其位于华盛顿特区的新办公室执行了一个价值200万美元的项目，为其提供一个作为战斗指挥部的专用空间。”CPTS还将在今年年底前出资38.7万美元，帮助改造施里弗空军基地教育中心。“这将允许在现场进行促销测试，而不是让我们的会员开车去彼得森测试中心，”马特奥说。“他们还可以提供其他测试服务，并有专门的教室进行专业研讨会和各种课程。这对我们的飞行员来说是一个巨大的生活质量改善。”拉斯韦尔希望财政年度的最后一个月能成为年轻飞行员的学习经历。飞行员可以从拉斯韦尔这样的人那里收集信息，而不是在紧张的时期，拉斯韦尔正在完成他的第四次收尾。“飞行员应该问尽可能多的问题，但也应该和积极参与这一过程的人坐在一起，观察他或她如何通过不同的系统工作，”拉斯韦尔说。“在某种程度上，随着时间的推移，[收尾]变得越来越容易，因为你开始了解在每年的这个时候应该寻找什么。”马特奥还确保飞行员在这个过程中了解他们的重要性，并强调他们的职责如何影响驻军。马蒂奥说：“我们的飞行员工作非常努力，不会受到设备老化、工作区域破旧以及担心薪水是否正确的限制。”。“需要一个团队来管理基地所有复杂的会计和预算。没有我们，我认为我们不可能在不同的任务组中执行纳税人的资金，也不可能维持我们的生活方式。”
256,Honor guard hosts first P-S GAR graduation,"The High Frontier Honor Guard hosted its first graduation since the COVID-19 pandemic and the standup of the Peterson-Schriever Garrison Sept. 1 at Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado.

The honor guard provides public and professional support to the community including retirement ceremonies and veteran funerals.

“A lot of the services we do are the last things families see regarding the military,” said Staff. Sgt. Michael Vialpando, High Frontier Honor Guard program manager. “It's important for [families] to see us give the most respectful and proper honors they deserve.”

To become a ceremonial guardsmen at the unit, Airmen must complete a two-week, 80 hour course that covers basic protocol and a ceremonial course that teaches the Airmen how to give the proper honors at any ceremony they support.

Vialpando said there is a high attrition rate due to the intensive training. “It's not for everybody. When you do funerals, a lot of people can't bear the atmosphere. You have to have thick skin to be here. We can't have someone breakdown or lose their bearing during a service.”

Seventeen Airmen completed the training and many would describe the experience as humbling.

“With my training and the support of my team, I know we’re well equipped to provide world-class support whenever we’re tasked to,” said Senior Airman Billie Fisler, High Frontier Honor Guard flight lead and distinguished graduate.

Despite the challenges 2020 has brought, the unit stays busy. In 2019, the High Frontier Honor Guard performed 473 services, 280 of those being funerals, with numbers projected to be similar at the end of this year.

Col. Jennifer Fitch, P-S GAR vice commander and presiding officer, charged the graduates to continue perfecting the skills they have learned to honor service members and their families.

257,PHC-P EMBLs shift gears to fight COVID-19,"TRIPLER ARMY MEDICAL CENTER, HONOLULU C For Public Health Command-Pacific Environmental Molecular Biology Laboratory personnel keeping others safe from disease is a top priority.

Located at Camp Zama, Japan, and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, the EMBLs’ mission is to protect the health of the force from vector borne diseases found in ticks, mosquitos, and fleas by testing arthropod samples found in austere environments. 

These services provide commanders insight to help mitigate disease risk and exposure in the Department of Defense community. 

“Our EMBLs are always on the cutting edge of identifying new diseases emerging in our area of responsibility,” explained Capt. Bradley Kearney, a biochemist and the PHC-P Laboratory Sciences director. “Normally, this is going to be vector borne diseases, but the EMBL mission is evolving.”

In January, Kearney and his team began tracking the news of an emerging new virus, SARS-CoV-2, with the help of Dr. Michael Butel, PHC-P’s chief of epidemiology. As the new disease, COVID-19, evolved, the team began to strategize ways the team could help clinical labs in Japan and Washington in the event of a pandemic. 

“We were having meetings frequently in preparation for what we anticipated would be a pandemic before it was hardly even called an epidemic,” said Kearney. “We normally don’t do human testing, but we were very far leaning forward in offering our hand out to assist other laboratory facilities, which have the certification to do human testing but did not have sufficient manpower or equipment to maintain a sustained testing surge.” 
 
As the weeks continued, PHC-P leadership and the EMBL teams worked to identify critical laboratory assets and skill sets to help with clinical testing at Madigan Army Medical Center in Washington and the Naval Health Research Center satellite laboratory co-located at Naval Hospital Yokosuka, Japan.

“Laboratory assets can take a very long time to spin up,” Kearney explained. “To get someone qualified to do laboratory testing the minimum threshold requires more than 50 weeks of advanced individual training, then an individual will need to do months of training in a clinical hospital. In order to have a rapid response we tapped into those that already had the training in place. Since our team conducts vector laboratory testing regularly we had 100% of our staff from both Japan and JBLM go to support clinical efforts due to the limited availability of laboratory testers.” 

To help fight COVID-19, Gary Crispell, a microbiologist, and Kearney launched COVID-19 testing in Japan while Milagros Solá, a microbiologist, and Spc. Darius Torres, a medical laboratory technician, supplemented the clinical lab staff at MAMC.

“You have to be highly qualified and trained on the right equipment to do COVID-19 testing,” said Solá. “We have to make sure that we are following all of the proper protocols to not only keep ourselves safe but to also make sure the samples are processed accurately. The results could be life or death for someone. Additionally, it takes a really special person to work under the stress and pressure of processing COVID-19 samples, because the results were needed by the medical staff yesterday.”

One of the most time-consuming portions of COVID-19 testing involved lysing, the process of breaking down a cell in order to release the genetic material for each sample.

“Every sample needs to be lysed and it could be a long process, since you have to pipette the sample multiple times before it can go onto an instrument to process it,” explained Torres. “If you don’t have enough people in the lab, you end up wasting a lot of time going back and forth between lysing the samples and running the equipment.”

By supplementing the lab staff at MAMC, Torres and Solá were able to take some of the stress off their clinical counterparts.
 
Kearney and Crispell, on the other hand, worked around the clock with one Navy contractor, Sheila Trisler, to single-handedly set up testing efforts for DoD personnel and family members stationed in Japan. 

“Rather than send samples back to San Diego to be processed, which would take precious time, we partnered with the Navy to stand up a testing location at the NHRC satellite lab,” explained Kearney. “We moved our specialized instrument from Camp Zama to Yokosuka and were able to run the first tests for DoD members within a week of the move.”

The new ability to test in Japan helped keep the DoD and naval missions going by quickly identifying pockets of COVID-19 and reducing spread within the community. 

“For me, it was very gratifying to run these clinical tests in order to clear personnel to go out on missions,” said Crispell. “But the most gratifying thing was when we found pockets of COVID in our community and worked with preventive medicine teams. They were able to respond quickly and conduct contact tracing to extinguish clusters of COVID.”

To reduce outbreaks, both locations partnered with preventive medicine teams to identify and test individuals who may have come in contact with COVID-19. 

“It truly is a team effort between laboratories and preventive medicine,” said Kearney. “Together, we do a lot of work behind the scenes to reduce the spread of diseases. Often people don’t even know about work we do together since we are stopping outbreaks before they happen.”

Kearney pointed out that while the overall footprint of microbiology and preventive medicine are relatively small within the medical community, the mission is extremely important, and they are ready to respond.
 
“Historically, disease and non-battle injuries have been the number one threat to military readiness,” said Kearney. “To help reduce this threat we are behind the scenes at all times ready to protect the DoD community as a whole.”
 
The ability to adapt and respond to the demands of COVID-19 has meant a lot to the PHC-P EMBL staff. 

For Solá helping the MAMC clinical lab was extremely personal. 

“Madigan was my first duty station,” said Solá. “I started out as an enlisted medical lab technician in 1993 and became the NCOIC. Three of the staff members that I used to work with are still there at the lab. I cannot explain how it makes me feel to be able to help my former teammates more than 25 years later as civilian employee. This mission is so incredibly important, I am very proud to help.”
   
While Solá has four years until retirement, Torres reflected on how this experience has impacted him as a young enlisted lab tech.
  
“A pandemic like this is not something that anyone ever expects. However, this experience has shown me that as a Soldier I’m not only able to battle what I was taught to fight, but together as a team we can battle such things as a pandemic.”

For Kearney, this experience is why he joined the Army. 

“The involvement with COVID-19 testing really gets at the reason why I joined the Army. I joined to provide my expertise and to provide my services as a biochemist to help support the warfighter and their families,” said Kearney. 

As members of PHC-P, Crispell, Kearney, Solá and Torres’s dedication to care for the health and well-being of others embraced the PHC-P credo of “100/0!” which means 100% accountability and responsibility and zero excuses for not giving your best every day. 

“Almost anything is achievable when all of the parties are invested,” said Crispell. “To me nothing is more important than the service members and civilians that we service.” 

As the Army continues to adapt to the demands of COVID-19, PHC-P EMBLs will continue to lead the way by providing reach back support for technical questions, and providing supplemental hands-on testing support in the event of a testing surge.

“For years, the Army’s number one priority has been readiness,” said Kearney. “The combined team of our Soldier, scientist and civilian workforce has directly and measurably made a positive impact on readiness during this pandemic. The Army laboratory enterprise stands with the rest of our healthcare force to continue the fight against COVID-19 and to support our warfighters with any medical challenge the future may hold.”",2020/8/27,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/376948/phc-p-embls-shift-gears-fight-covid-19,"HONOLULU, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],檀香山，你好，美国,PHC-P EMBLs换档以对抗新冠病毒-19,檀香山TRIPLER陆军医疗中心――对于公共卫生司令部太平洋环境分子生物学实验室人员来说，保护他人免受疾病危害是头等大事。位于日本扎马营地和华盛顿刘易斯・麦科德联合基地，EMBLs的任务是通过测试在恶劣环境中发现的节肢动物样本，保护部队的健康免受蜱、蚊子和跳蚤中发现的媒介传播疾病的影响。这些服务为指挥官提供洞察，帮助降低国防部社区的疾病风险和暴露。生物化学家兼PHC-P实验室科学主任布拉德利・卡尼（Bradley Kearney）上尉解释说：“我们的EMBLs始终处于识别责任领域新出现疾病的前沿。”。“正常情况下，这将是媒介传播的疾病，但EMBL任务正在演变。”1月，卡尼和他的团队在PHC-P的流行病学主管迈克尔・巴特尔博士的帮助下，开始跟踪新出现的SARS-CoV-2病毒的消息。随着新疾病――新冠病毒-19的发展，研究小组开始制定策略，以便在发生大流行时帮助日本和华盛顿的临床实验室。卡尼说：“我们经常开会，为我们预期的大流行做准备，而大流行甚至还没有被称为流行病。”。“我们通常不进行人体试验，但我们在帮助其他实验室设施方面向前倾斜了很多，这些实验室有进行人体试验的认证，但没有足够的人力或设备来维持持续的试验激增。”随着几周的继续，PHC-P领导层和EMBL团队致力于确定关键实验室资产和技能集，以帮助在华盛顿的Madigan陆军医疗中心和位于日本横须贺海军医院的海军健康研究中心卫星实验室进行临床试验。“实验室资产可能需要很长时间才能运转。”卡尼解释道。“为了让某人有资格进行实验室测试，最低限度需要50周以上的高级个人培训，然后一个人需要在临床医院进行数月的培训。为了快速做出反应，我们利用了已经进行过培训的人员。因为我们的团队进行了病媒实验室培训由于实验室检测人员的有限，我们让来自日本和JBLM的100%的员工都去支持临床工作。”为了帮助对抗新冠病毒19，微生物学家加里・克里斯佩尔和卡尼在日本启动了新冠病毒19检测，而微生物学家米拉格罗斯・索拉和Spc.Darius Torres，一名医学实验室技术员补充了MAMC的临床实验室工作人员。“你必须具备很高的资格，并接受过正确设备的培训，才能进行新冠病毒-19检测，”Solá说。“我们必须确保遵守所有适当的协议，不仅确保我们自己的安全，而且确保样本得到准确处理。结果可能是某人的生命或死亡。此外，需要一个非常特殊的人在处理新冠病毒-19样本的压力下工作，因为结果“新冠病毒-19测试最耗时的部分之一是裂解，即分解细胞以释放每个样本的遗传物质的过程。托雷斯解释说：“每个样本都需要进行分析，这可能是一个漫长的过程，因为你必须用移液管多次才能将样本移到仪器上进行处理。如果实验室里没有足够的人员，你最终会在分析样本和运行设备之间来回浪费大量时间。”通过补充MAMC的实验室工作人员，托雷斯和索拉能够减轻临床同行的一些压力。另一方面，卡尼和克里斯佩尔与海军承包商希拉・特里斯勒（Sheila Trisler）日以继夜地合作，单独为驻扎在日本的国防部人员和家属建立测试工作。卡尼解释说：“我们没有将样本送回圣地亚哥进行处理（这将花费宝贵的时间），而是与海军合作，在NHRC卫星实验室设立了一个测试地点。我们将我们的专用仪器从扎马营地转移到横须贺，并能够在转移后一周内为国防部成员进行第一次测试。”在日本进行测试的新能力有助于国防部和海军的任务继续进行，因为它可以快速识别出新冠病毒-19的口袋，并减少在社区内的传播。“对我来说，进行这些临床测试是非常令人满意的，以便让人员能够执行任务，”Crispell说。“但最令人欣慰的是，我们在社区中发现了一些新冠病毒，并与预防医学小组合作。他们能够迅速做出反应，并进行接触追踪，以消灭成串的新冠病毒。”为了减少疫情爆发，这两个地区都与预防医学团队合作，以确定和检测可能接触过新冠病毒-19的个人。“这确实是实验室和预防医学之间的团队努力，”卡尼说。“我们一起在幕后做了大量工作，以减少疾病的传播。通常人们甚至不知道我们一起做的工作，因为我们在疫情发生之前就阻止了疫情的爆发。”卡尼指出，虽然微生物学和预防医学在医学界的总体影响相对较小，但这项任务极其重要，他们随时准备作出反应。“从历史上看，疾病和非战斗伤害一直是军事准备的头号威胁，”卡尼说。“为了帮助减少这种威胁，我们随时准备在幕后保护整个国防部社区。”适应和响应新冠病毒要求的能力对PHC-P EMBL工作人员来说意义重大。对于索拉来说，帮助MAMC临床实验室是非常个人化的。“麦迪根是我的第一个工作地点，”索拉说。“我从1993年开始是一名应征入伍的医疗实验室技术员，后来成为了NCOIC。我曾经共事的三名工作人员现在仍在实验室。我无法解释25年后作为文职雇员能够帮助我的前队友的感受。这项任务是如此的重要，我非常自豪能够虽然索拉离退休还有四年的时间，但托雷斯反思了这段经历对他作为一名年轻的实验室技术人员的影响。“像这样的大流行不是任何人都能预料到的。然而，这段经历告诉我，作为一名士兵，我不仅能够与我被教导要与之战斗的东西战斗，而且作为一个团队，我们可以一起与大流行这样的事情作斗争。”对于卡尼来说，这段经历就是他参军的原因。“参与新冠病毒-19测试确实是我参军的原因。我参军是为了提供我的专业知识，并作为一名生物化学家提供服务，以帮助支持战士及其家人。”作为PHC-P的成员，Crispell、Kearney、Solá和Torres致力于关心他人的健康和福祉，他们信奉PHC-P的信条“100/0！”，这意味着100%的责任感和责任感，没有理由不每天都做到最好。克里斯佩尔说：“当所有各方都投入时，几乎任何事情都是可以实现的。对我来说，没有什么比我们所服务的军人和平民更重要了。”随着陆军继续适应新冠病毒-19的要求，PHC-P EMBLs将继续领先，为技术问题提供回访支持，并在测试激增时提供补充的动手测试支持。“多年来，陆军的首要任务一直是做好准备，”卡尼说。“我们的士兵、科学家和文职人员组成的联合团队在这场大流行期间对战备状态产生了直接和可测量的积极影响。陆军实验室企业与我们的其他医疗力量站在一起，继续与新冠病毒-19作斗争，并支持我们的作战人员应对未来可能面临的任何医疗挑战。”
258,USS John P. Murtha Holds Change of Command Ceremony,"SAN DIEGO (July 10, 2020) Capt. Gervy J. Alota assumed command of San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship USS John P. Murtha (LPD 26) from Capt. Kevin A. Lane during a change of command ceremony July 10.

Alota’s most recent assignments were Deputy Director for Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center Sea Combat Division and Deputy Executive Assistant for the Vice Chief of Naval Operations.

Lane’s tour aboard lasted from February 2015 to July 2020. He began his tour as executive officer before ascending to commanding officer in April 2019. He guided the ship through the pre-commissioning process, her first deployment which yielded a Battle Efficiency award. He was also instrumental in John P.Murtha’s participation in Rim of the Pacific 2018 Exercise, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Orion Program Underway Recovery Testing twice and the ship’s first basic and integrated phase training cycle.

259,NAVSUP WSS awards P-8A contract to small business,"NAVSUP Weapon Systems Support (WSS) awarded a five-year, Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ), long-term contract for the P-8A Poseidon Maritime aircraft estimated at $30 million to small business, S&K Aerospace, in May 2020. 

“It is a first time “break-out” where a small business will be responsible to manage the repair/upgrade and overhaul of 362 commercial common weapon replaceable assemblies (WRAs) used in support of the P-8A Poseidon Maritime aircraft,” said Debra Zaslow, Contracting Officer for PBL Center of Excellence.   

These items have been deemed “commercial common,” or items that can be used on both the P-8A, as well as, the Boeing 737 aircraft and were previously repaired primarily by large business Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). 

“Under this contract, small businesses, performing as prime and subcontractors, will play a vital role in supporting the Navy’s P-8A aircraft. S&K Aerospace will manage parts repairs, upgrades and overhauls, and notify the Government contracting office of commercial configuration changes and obsolescence-related issues,” said Annette Stevenson, Deputy Director, NAVSUP WSS Office of Small Business Programs.

Since these 362 items are identical to the ones used on the Boeing 737, it was decided by the NAVAIR Program Office that items could be repaired at various Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Part 145 Repair Stations.

“These are the large nation-wide and world-wide networks of repair facilities used by airlines and other private aircraft, all of which are governed by FAA regulations,” said Zaslow. “S&K Aerospace has in-depth knowledge of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-governed repair processes, infrastructure, and regulations.”

This is the first time that NAVSUP WSS has procured repairs/upgrades/overhauls from approved Federal Aviation Administration 145 Repair Stations. As the prime contractor, S&K Aerospace will be responsible for maintaining all items under this contract and coordinating the necessary repair work to return items to ready for issue (RFI) condition via repair stations. 

This contract will enhance overall mission readiness for the P-8A weapon system by leveraging the existing commercial common items repair competitive environment to achieve benefits in cost and repair turnaround time. 

“This was an extremely complex requirement and source selection process involving multiple functional area experts across the Integrated Weapons Support Team, Contracting Department, Legal Counsel, and Office of Small Business,” said Lt. Cmdr. Ryan Tobin, Deputy Director for NAVSUP WSS PBL Center of Excellence. “This highly functional Source Selection Team analyzed all proposals and ultimately chose S&K Aerospace as providing best value to the government based on their successful performance approach, past performance, small business subcontracting plan, and price. This award is a big win for NAVSUP WSS, small business, and the P-8A community” 

NAVSUP WSS is one of 11 commands under Commander, NAVSUP. Headquartered in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and employing a diverse, worldwide workforce of more than 22,500 military and civilian personnel, NAVSUP's mission is to provide supplies, services, and quality-of-life support to the Navy and joint warfighter.

260,PHC-P Soldier recognized as 2020 MEDCOM Exceptional SARC,"Maj. Ran Du, Public Health Command-Pacific’s sexual assault response coordinator, was recognized as the 2020 Medical Command Exceptional SARC on May 7. 

Nominated for his efforts leading the PHC-P Sexual Harassment Assault Response and Prevention program, Du will represent MEDCOM as the nominee for the 2020 Department of Army Exceptional SARC award. 

“Each year, the Department of Defense recognizes one Exceptional Sexual Assault Response Coordinator from each of the services,” said Col. Heidi Mon, PHC-P’s commander. “We are very proud that Maj. Du’s nomination will now compete at the Department of Army level. His commitment to the SHARP program embodies the PHC-P credo of ‘100/0!’ which means 100 percent accountability and responsibility and zero excuses for not giving our best every day.” 

During his time as the PHC-P SARC, Du created an integrated and robust SHARP program across a geographically dispersed brigade. The program provides support to more than 500 personnel assigned to more than 50 installations, spanning five different countries and five U.S. states and territories within the Indo-Pacific. 
 
Du personally met with each of the five subordinate battalion commanders and actively engaged more than 14 victim advocates to ensure unit leaders fully supported the SHARP program.

“It all starts with the command’s support,” said Du. “It enables our victim advocates to promote a push for change rather than just having everyone participate in the mandatory training.”

To help advocate a change in culture, Du also assisted battalion victim advocates in partnering with local SHARP programs on Army, Navy, and Air Force installations to create an extended SHARP network. This integrated network ensured potential victims received the same services regardless of location.

“By working together as a team, we are able to encourage survivors to file reports while preventing sexual assault within the brigade before they happen,” Du said. “We are stronger together, and together we are here to advocate for the survivors’ needs.”  

As COVID-19 restrictions and stay-at-home orders went into effect in March, Du continued to advocate teamwork and cultural changes despite social distancing. Rather than letting Sexual Assault Awareness Prevention Month fall to the side, Du worked with victim advocates to host a virtual 5K race and Denim Day contest to help raise SAAPM awareness throughout the month of April. 

With hundreds of participants, Du and his team strengthened the commitment to cultural change and the SHARP program throughout the brigade by leading the way in the Indo-Pacific. 

“There are a lot of great things about the SHARP program, but I definitely think that it comes down to teamwork and commitment to the program,” Du explained. “When everyone is committed and willing to take on this challenge as a unit, great things happen. I think that if everyone in the Army can do what we did then we can definitely eliminate sexual assault.”

For Du, this nomination isn’t about him; it’s about the entire PHC-P team, he said.

“It’s a great honor to have the nomination, and I think of it as a team award,” explained Du. “It really is a reflection of teamwork and the work that our victim advocates have done throughout the brigade.”",2020/5/12,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/369816/phc-p-soldier-recognized-2020-medcom-exceptional-sarc,"HONOLULU, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],檀香山，你好，美国,PHC-P士兵被公认为2020年MEDCOM特殊SARC,5月7日，太平洋公共卫生司令部的性攻击反应协调员Ran Du少校被认定为2020年医疗司令部特别SARC。杜因领导PHC-P性骚扰应对和预防计划而获得提名，他将代表MEDCOM获得2020年陆军部特殊SARC奖提名人。PHC-P指挥官Heidi Mon上校说：“每年，国防部都会从每个军种中选出一名出色的性攻击反应协调员。”。“我们非常自豪杜少校的提名现在将在陆军部一级竞争。他对夏普计划的承诺体现了PHC-P“100/0！”的信条，这意味着100%的责任感和责任感，以及没有理由不每天尽全力。”在他担任PHC-P SARC期间，Du在一个地理位置分散的旅中创建了一个完整而强大的SHARP项目。该计划为500多名人员提供支持，这些人员被分配到印度洋-太平洋地区的50多个设施，分布在五个不同的国家和五个美国州和地区。杜军亲自会见了五名下属营指挥官，并积极与14名受害者权益倡导者进行了接触，以确保部队领导充分支持夏普计划。“这一切都是从司令部的支持开始的，”杜军说。“这使我们的受害者倡导者能够推动变革，而不仅仅是让每个人都参加强制性培训。”为了帮助倡导文化变革，杜还协助营受害者倡导者与陆军、海军和空军设施上的当地夏普项目合作，创建一个扩展的夏普网络。这一综合网络确保了潜在受害者无论在何处都能得到相同的服务。“通过团队合作，我们能够鼓励幸存者提交报告，同时在发生性攻击之前防止旅内发生性攻击，”杜说。“我们一起变得更强大，我们一起在这里倡导幸存者的需求。”随着新冠病毒-19限制和留在家中命令在3月份生效，杜继续倡导团队合作和文化变革，尽管社会距离越来越远。杜没有让性侵犯意识预防月落在一边，而是与受害者权益倡导者合作举办了一场虚拟的5公里比赛和牛仔日比赛，以帮助在整个4月份提高对SAAPM的认识。在数百人的参与下，杜和他的团队通过在印度-太平洋地区的领先地位，加强了对整个旅文化变革和夏普计划的承诺。“夏普项目有很多很棒的地方，但我绝对认为这要归结为团队合作和对项目的承诺，”杜解释说。“当每个人都致力于并愿意作为一个单位接受这一挑战时，伟大的事情就会发生。我认为，如果军队中的每个人都能像我们那样做，那么我们肯定可以消除性侵犯。”对于杜，这个提名与他无关；“这关乎整个PHC-P团队，”他说，“获得提名是一种莫大的荣誉，我认为这是一个团队奖，”杜解释道。“这确实反映了团队合作以及我们的受害者辩护律师在整个旅中所做的工作。”

The Complex Business Operations Workload Management (OBWC) team brought extensive knowledge of the IPV program, and went to work immediately as subject matter experts putting plans in place in support of maintenance operations and accomplished astounding program numbers, many thought the IPV program would never see.

While turning heads over the last 18 months and with through the use of Art of the Possible, they began raising goals which has allowed for program constraints and road barriers to be quickly resolved.

The management team began exceeding the challenging requirements and expectations for this program through management of the IPV kitting process by developing an internal program dashboard used for tracking status and part supportability.

This dashboard has ultimately allowed a clear look into program constraints, resulting in outstanding numbers in kitting fulfillment and raising part supportability from a steady 19% month to month average to a steady 95% fulfillment.

With continued support towards the mission, the team successfully accomplished part supportabilities highest kitting fulfillment percentage reported at 92.95% for June, to 99.53% in July 2019, and lowest level of backlogged kits reported, from 262 to under 50 during the same time resulting in measured savings to the U.S. Air Force over $876 thousand dollars and hundreds of hours in the last 12 months.

263,USS John P. Murtha Underway for NASA's Orion Mission,"SAN DIEGO - San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock USS John P. Murtha (LPD 26) is underway to conduct Underway Recovery Test (URT) 7 in conjunction with NASA off the coast of Southern California. 
 
URT is part of a U.S. government interagency effort to safely practice and evaluate recovery processes, procedures, hardware and personnel in an open ocean environment that will be used to recover the Orion spacecraft upon its return to Earth.   
 
This will be the first time John P. Murtha will conduct a URT mission with NASA. Throughout the history of the program, a variety of San Antonio-class LPD ships have been utilized to train and prepare NASA and the Navy, utilizing a Boiler Plate Test Article (BTA).  The BTA is a mock capsule, designed to roughly the same size, shape, and center of gravity as the Crew Module which will be used for Orion.  
 
NASA and Navy teams have taken lessons learned from previous recovery tests to improve operations and ensure the ability to safely and successfully recover the Orion capsule when it returns to Earth following Exploration Mission-1 (EM-1) in December 2019. 
 
EM-1 will be an uncrewed flight, whose successful completion hopes to pave the way for future crewed missions and enable future missions to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.  
 
During URT-7, John P. Murtha will conduct restricted maneuvering operations. Small boats carrying Navy and NASA divers will deploy alongside the BTA to rig tending lines, guiding the capsule to Anchorage as the ship safely operates on station.  
 
Conducting both daytime and nighttime recovery operations, NASA crew members will work alongside the Navy to manage how the capsule is brought in, set down and safely stored.  

 NASA plans to conduct two more URT missions before EM-1 takes place. 
 
John P. Murtha is homeported in San Diego and is part of Naval Surface Forces and U.S. 3rd Fleet.

264,Fort Hood Soldiers complete first MAP-P at CTC,"KILLEEN, TX C Seven active duty Soldiers assigned to units on Fort Hood, graduated August 9th from Central Texas College’s Military Articulation Paramedic program. 

The program, the first of its kind for CTC, allows active duty Soldiers to earn their paramedic certification in less time than traditionally required, all while maintaining their active duty requirement.

Congressman John Carter, was one of the distinguished guest speakers for the evening. 

“You are the first, a first of something definitely needed for the Army,” Carter said. “So I really appreciate what we are doing here today; this will help men and women in uniform improve their skills while serving and meeting their obligations in the military.”

While the Soldiers have graduated from the program, they still will need to receive their certification through testing with the National Registry to be able to officially practice as a paramedic.
 
“Military Articulation Paramedic program gives the opportunities to expand the knowledge so they will be even more effective Soldiers,” Carter said. “It gives them skills they can use in the workforce when they get out.”

The class salutatorian and 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team Soldier, Cpl. Jewel Lewis, 215th Brigade Support Battalion, was excited to have finished the course.

“It was an honor graduating this course,” said Lewis. “It was a long 9 and a half months, but it was good. We were able to advance our medical knowledge and I think it’s a very good opportunity for all the medics, but also people who are interested in the medical field.”

Lewis and most of her classmates are planning to continue their education by taking the offered Army courses, to become flight medics.

With support from government officials like Carter, Central Texas College administrators, and Fort Hood leadership, the classes will continue to be offered for Soldiers who are interested.

265,SMSgt Billing receives AFRC Lance P. Sijan award,"When the award was first presented in 1981, it was named in honor of the first U.S. Air Force Academy graduate to receive the Medal of Honor C Capt. Lance P. Sijan.

 Sijan was shot down over Vietnam Nov. 9, 1967, and evaded capture for 45 days despite enduring serious injuries. He later died as a POW in Vietnam and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for heroism. Today, the Lance P. Sijan awarded is presented to individuals who have demonstrated outstanding leadership abilities across all Air Force Specialty Codes.

 Senior Master Sgt. James Billing, 434th Maintenance Squadron production superintendent, recently received the Lance P. Sijan award for all of Air Force Reserve Command for his leadership excellence from June 2016 to June 2017.

“Senior Master Sgt. Billing's position as the Assistant Superintendent for the 434th Maintenance Squadron requires a high degree of maintenance discipline, teamwork, leadership and skill all of which he possess in spades,” said Maj. Nicole Fink, 434th Maintenance Squadron commander. His sound decision making and stellar work ethic made him the ideal nominee for the Lance P. Sijan award.""

 Billing was notified he received the Sijan award during a deployment to Turkey.

“It’s an honor to be nominated for it and to win for all of Air Force Reserve Command,” Billing said. “It just shows the great people that we have and are working with. Any leadership award comes down to the people that work for you C that do the job for you. They’re the ones that make my job easier. And our maintenance guys are outstanding; they do a great job and our planes are known to outdo active-duty and the Reserve for how well they fly and how they look. That all comes down to our maintenance guys.”

During the period which the award covers, Billing filled the role of multiple positions.

“When I was deployed to Turkey, I was the lead production superintendent there, covering all flightline maintenance,” Billing said. “We were able to set up Incirlik from bare bones; there was nothing there to support tankers; and we were able to fly missions within 24 hours. Then, here [at Grissom] I filled in for Chief Cassidy as the superintendent while he was deployed and maintained the day-today operations. In Chief Cassidy’s absence, I oversaw 10 maintenance back shops, coordinated with the flightline to make sure all planes flew and maintenance was done.”

Although Billing said he is unsure why he was nominated for the award, others disagree.

 ""Senior Master Sgt. Billing is a consummate professional who is very deserving of this award,"" said Lt. Col. Dwight Meese, 434th Maintenance Group commander. “Senior Master Sgt. Billing important in his management of the MXS Periodic Inspection (PE) process, ensuring inspections are completed in a safe and timely manner so that the aircraft can be put back in the flying rotation with minimal downtime.""

267,RHC-P Soldiers compete for the honor to wear the GAFPB badge,"SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, HAWAII -- Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) Soldiers competed in the 2017 German Armed Forces Proficiency Badge (GAFPB) event co-hosted by the 303rd Ordinance Battalion (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. Soldiers from RHC-P competed alongside over 200 Soldiers from units around Oahu.

The GAFPB (German: Abzeichen für Leistungen im Truppendienst) is a decoration of the German Armed Forces, authorized for wear by the U.S. military, and awarded to soldiers of all ranks.  The GAFPB is one of the few approved foreign awards, and it is one of the most sought after awards to achieve.  

""As a Soldier who has earned a GAFPB badge, it was natural for me to step-up and assist with the coordination of this year's event,"" stated Master Sgt. Javier Najera, non-commissioned officer in charge, RHC-P.  ""Master Sgt. Elisa Todd was also a driving force during the planning and execution of this event. She stepped up and worked side-by-side with me to ensure all participants experienced a streamlined process so that they could perform to their highest ability.""

RHC-P participants included Army Medicine Soldiers from the U.S. Army Recruiting Command, Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC), U.S. Army Health Clinic-Schofield Barracks (USAHC-SB), Dental Health Command-Pacific (DHC-P), Public Health Command-Pacific (PHC-P) and 18th Medical Command-Deployment Support (18th MEDCOM).  

Competitors faced four events over the course of three days. 

During day one of competition the first task Soldiers were challenged with was a 100 meter swim while wearing ACUs. Swimmers had a time constraint of four minutes and upon completion of the swim had to tread water and remove their ACUs. Day one continued in the afternoon with the basic fitness test consisting of an 11x10m sprint, a flex arm hang (chin-up test) and a 1000 meter run. 

A pistol qualification test awaited competitors on the second day.  Individuals fired an M9 in a prone position (2 shots), kneeling position (2 shots) and standing position (2 shots).  

The last day of competition was the ruck march.  Each Soldier rucked the distance carrying a 33 pound ruck sack.

In the end, thirteen RHC-P Soldiers earned a silver badge, while 8 Soldiers earned a bronze badge. Each competitor’s achievement was recognized at an award's ceremony held on Hamilton Field at Schofield Barracks on August 10, 2017.  Leaders from around the island came out to honor those who competed in this year’s event.

“The Soldiers who competed for the GAFPB this week are an example of the strength of force in our ranks,” stated Sgt. Maj.

268,RHC-P paves way for global health engagements in 2016,"HONOLULU--It is through strong partnerships with U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) and U.S. Army in the Pacific (USARPAC) that Army Medicine’s Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) is able to commit the resources to provide greater physical and mental well-being through rapidly growing global health engagements. 

RHC-P alongside other U.S. government agencies, partner nations and global health stakeholders are constantly redefining, and refining, global health activities to improve the well-being of citizens in the Pacific. The combined efforts increase stability and cooperation in the Pacific and beyond.  Global health efforts are also inextricably linked to other disciplines and society sectors such as agriculture, economics, environment, religion and veterinary science which continually impact the global health field. 

Every engagement RHC-P commits resources to enhances our regional health partnerships and ensures our nation’s military force is ready to support any mission.

Global health activities are accomplished through various operations and activities including conferences, bi-lateral subject matter expert exchanges, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief exercises and medical support to operational missions in conjunction with partner nations.
Global health engagements (GHE) activities also include developing and implementing health preparedness measures and responses to threats like infectious diseases (zika, ebola, malaria, avian influenza, etc.) and non-communicable diseases (cancers, diabetes, heart diseases, etc.) that are not adequately controlled, prevented or deterred by a country’s boundaries. 

RHC-P's involvement with global health engagements has also allowed the region to gain credibility among the 36 Indo-Asia-Pacific countries in our area of responsibility.

“Army medicine has gained credibility as a partner of choice through our persistent health engagements with nations here in the Pacific,” says Lt. Col. Derek Licina, director, GHE, RHC-P. “We are still shaping how Army Medicine and the Department of Defense more systematically resource, plan, execute and assess global health engagements.  However, initial evaluations conducted by the Uniformed Services University Center for Global Health Engagement highlight GHEs are supporting U.S. government strategic objectives, generating readiness for our service members, and increasing the capacity of our partners to prepare for and conduct crisis response activities.”   

Over the past few years RHC-P has conducted approximately 60 health engagements, involving over 20 of the 36 countries in RHC-P’s area of responsibility in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. The activities ranged from medical missions in partner countries to senior leader engagements at the region and at RHC-P’s military medical centers and clinics. 

Here is a quick look back at the 2016 health missions and senior leader engagements RHC-P conducted.

BANGLADESH

RHC-P’s efforts in Bangladesh support a U.S. Agency for International Development program where Army providers and Bangladesh civilian medical professionals assist women by surgically repairing fistulas. This mission also provides readiness training for providers while meeting country security cooperation objectives. During the most recent mission, 36 surgeries were performed and 13 lectures presented at leading medical facilities attended by over 800 Bangladeshi health professionals.

CAMBODIA

During the blood safety health engagement series, health professionals from RHC-P established and built upon relationships with Cambodia’s military medical staff and civilian provincial health managers. The team’s efforts facilitated a broad outreach effort to promote confidence and trust within the community and advanced Army Medicine objectives in support of PACOM and USARPAC’s strategic objectives.  The result was the opening of a critical asset, a national blood bank in Cambodia.  This health engagement effort enhances Cambodia’s ability to provide critical support to the civilian population, while supporting land forces contribution to regional and global security.  
CHINA

During the fall, RHC-P supported USARPAC and USPACOM efforts to engage China through a subject matter expert exchange focusing on acupuncture. Through the exchange, each nation increased their understanding of other unique approaches to health based on culture and science. The Chinese delegation gained a deeper understanding of how RHC-P’s military treatment facilities uses western and eastern medicine, while RHC-P gained insight into how traditional Chinese medicine can potentially assist with the management of patients with chronic pain, post-traumatic stress disorder and in response to disaster situations.

The visit by the Chinese delegation builds upon, and continues, subject matter expert exchanges between the two nations. 

KINGDOM OF THAILAND

A senior leader engagement between RHC-P and the Kingdom of Thailand provided the leaders in the Thai delegation a better understanding of how RHC-P orchestrates the delivery of world-class medical care for service members, families and eligible beneficiaries while enabling medical readiness and conducting health diplomacy in the Pacific.

RHC-P leadership recognized the Thai’s significant contributions to past global health engagements and regional exercises and encouraged future support and participation. Leaders from both sides expressed interest in identifying future ways to leverage health engagements to build upon a regionally sustainable health capacity that supports regional security.

PALAU

RHC-P’s Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC) continued a long standing health mission with the Palau Ministry of Health.  This mission provides significant training value for both countries’ medical professionals while offering specialized surgical procedures for Palau citizens in need. 

For RHC-P Soldiers this on-going mission improves operational and deployment skill sets, enhances medical decision making in a resource constrained environment and increases medical proficiencies in foreign environments. During the most recent mission, providers also offered medical training to local medical staff on the evaluation and treatment of diseases of the head and neck.  

Over 400 outpatients were seen using more than 100 clinic procedures and 35 operative cases during this mission.  

SINGAPORE

TAMC, one of RHC-P’s largest subordinate military treatment facilities, supported an outbreak detection and intervention workshop in Singapore where the Department of Preventive Medicine C Infection Control & Epidemiology Service joined 41 participants from Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and the United States to improve infectious disease surveillance. Participants came from a diversity of backgrounds including health policy, epidemiology, public health and veterinary medicine.

The group worked together to advocated for decisive, safe, and effective outbreak response mechanisms, avenues to support the adoption of the International Health Regulation and worked towards sensitizing medical and disaster planners to ethical considerations in outbreak response. The course covered outbreak surveillance and intervention in a progression of differing contexts.  There were didactic sessions, tabletop and risk communication exercises, Ebola triage exercises as well as practical exercises. 

SRI LANKA

During an engagement in Sri Lanka, RHC-P taught humanitarian assistance/disaster relief (HA/DR) planning techniques to civilians, military and interagency governmental partners. The HA/DR mission established a relationship with local and interagency military medical staff to provide general medical, dental, optometry, and physical medicine care to underserved population in the host country. A medical exchange with subject matter experts on casualty evacuation, biomedical equipment repair and community public health outreach programs were also conducted.

The HA/DR effort also included an engineering project to repair local schools and public buildings while delivering medical services and donating medical supplies and equipment to the school. A total of almost 4000 patients were seen over five days.  This mission was successful in enhancing multi-national cooperation and improving local infrastructure and capabilities. 

VIETNAM

A seven-person Vietnamese delegation visited RHC-P for a command brief and tour of TAMC. The visit allowed leaders from both countries to share professional experiences in an effort to further strengthen the military medical and health partnerships in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region. 

The Vietnamese delegates expressed interest in future opportunities to work on building and expanding on sustainable health capacity in areas such as laboratory management, orthopedics, pain management, search and rescue, and disaster medicine.

FUTURE of GHEs at RHC-P

As RHC-P continues to move forward in 2017 and beyond, the region alongside PACOM and USARPAC, will strengthen and sustain relationships and friendships already forged, build new relationships and continue to provide quality health care to those in need or without access to basic or specialized medical care around the Pacific.

Planning for on-going and future global health engagements requires a focus on promoting cooperation, building capacity and taking actions to enhance stability with, within, and around partner and host nations across all service components as well as with other stakeholders.
  
RHC-P’s global health engagement team is also helping to set the standard for all service branches participating in health engagements efforts. The team recently attended the Association of Military Surgeons United States' (AMSUS) 125th annual meeting. At AMSUS the team presented a poster and participated in a panel to share experience based best practices which generated interest among attendees as a way to standardize global health efforts, approaches and standard operating procedures for future global health engagements.

National Guard Winston P. Wilson Small Arms Championships
~ 46th WPW Championship & 26th AFSAM

By Master Sgt. Jonathan D. Brizendine, National Guard Marksmanship Training Center

ROBINSON MANEUVER TRAINING CENTER, Ark. C Members of the Arkansas National Guard Marksmanship Training Center (NGMTC) prepare for the Guard’s national level marksmanship competitions scheduled to begin here April 22.

Events on the schedule include the 46th Winston P. Wilson (WPW) Sniper Championship (April 22 C April 27) and the 46th WPW Championship (April 30 C May 4), as well as, a multinational and interservice competition, the 26th Armed Forces Skill at Arms Meeting (AFSAM) (April 30 C May 5). These matches are designed to promote marksmanship training through competition between service members that is battle-focused using a controlled stressful environment.

This year’s WPW and AFSAM matches will include service members from Active Duty, National Guard, Marine Corp, Air Force, and Foreign Allies engaging targets with the M4/M4A1 and M16A2/A4 Rifles, and M21/M14, M24, M110/SR 25, M40A and M2010 sniper weapon systems at Ft. Chaffee Joint Maneuver Training Center, Ark. Each two-man sniper team will be evaluated on field firing, advanced marksmanship, field craft, shooter and spotter communication, and target engagement with a sidearm. 

While the snipers compete for top honors at Ft. Chaffee, other contenders will be zeroing their weapons on ranges at Robinson Maneuver Training Center in preparation for the small arms WPW Championship and AFSAM. Subsequent courses of fire will test their expertise with the M9 Pistol, the M4/M16 Rifle, and the M500 Shotgun.

Each match will culminate with an awards banquet celebrating the winners of individual, team events and the overall best performers. 

“Our soldiers and airmen have worked countless hours all year to ensure competitors have a safe and challenging experience,” said Col. Dennis J. Humphrey, NGMTC Commander. “As returning competitors can attest, all who attend are sure to come away with new contacts, new skills, and the pride of having represented their unit and region.”

This year’s matches are attracting more than 500 marksmen from around the globe. With national teams going head-to-head with one another and foreign allied teams from as far away as Italy, it promises to be a memorable experience for all who attend. Perhaps most importantly, competitors are certain to come away with more than just trophies.

“As competitive as they are, the matches aren’t solely about defining who is the best,” said Lt. Col. Todd C. Stuff, NGMTC Administrative Officer. “Ultimately, the focus is on training.”

“When the best marksmen from around the globe come together,” he continued “they bring with them valuable experience and insight which they enthusiastically share with their fellow warriors. The shooters then take what they learn back to their units and pass along their new skillsets to their soldiers and airmen.”

Training for accuracy is most important.

“The end goal is increased accuracy resulting in more troops coming home from deployments in one piece,” said Stuff. “When that happens, we’re all winners.”

272,RHC-P enhances emergency response during RIMPAC 2016,"FORD ISLAND, Hawaii (July, 14, 2016) -- Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P) successfully led key medical activities aimed at enhancing humanitarian aid and disaster relief efforts across the region as part of Rim of the Pacific 2016. One such activity included a humanitarian assistance / disaster relief (HA/DR) scenario, developed in coordination with leaders from the Healthcare Association of Hawaii (HAH) and the Hawaii Disaster Medical Assistance Team (HDMAT), structured with the goal of enhancing disaster preparedness across U.S. and international partner government and private sector agencies. 
RHC-P Emergency Manager and a lead medical planner for the HA/DR, Thomas Bookman, said the plan not only rehearsed emergency response capabilities of Hawaii-area partners through the simulated movement of patients across 19 Hawaii-island area hospitals by land, air and sea, but the drill engaged Pacific partners, enhancing preparedness region-wide. 
A total of 312 simulated casualties were moved during the exercise.
“In the event of a national disaster, ports might be damaged, our international airports might be destroyed, and so we are going to be on our own for a long period of time. In the midst of a real crisis isn’t when you should start developing relationships. That partnership needs to be reinforced prior to that event ever happening,” Bookman said.
Bookman played a lead role in the scenario, acting as the minister of health for the fictional island of Griffin and working closely with international community liaisons with a multitude of organizations such as the International Federation of Red Cross, Japan’s Humanitarian Assistance and Emergency Relief Division of the International Cooperation Bureau, and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Additionally, teams from Canada, Australia, other foreign USAID equivalents, and international military partners in the Japanese Navy and Canadian Air Force played roles in the exercise. 
In addition to RHC-P, U.S. participants also included Tripler Army Medical Center, Healthcare Association of Hawaii, Hawaii Disaster Medical Assistance Team, Hawaii Disaster Aeromedical Staging Facility, the U.S. Army Health Clinic-Schofield Barracks, Veterans Affairs Pacific Islands Health Care System, 18th Medical Command, U.S. Army Garrison-Hawaii, 15th Medical Group CJoint-Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Marine Corps Base Kaneohe and 25th Infantry Division Combat Aviation Brigade. 
RHC-P also supported the Uniformed Services University Center for Global Health Engagements course on the Fundamentals of Global Health Engagements which included military and civilian representatives from all U.S. services, as well as international participants representing Australia, Canada, and China. 
Lt. Col. Derek Licina, RHC-P Director for Global Health Engagements (GHE), facilitated one of the lectures in a classroom setting and said that the? engagement provided an opportunity to share GHE best practices with international partners, which supports service component and combatant command Theater Security Cooperation objectives.
""The opportunity to candidly discuss global health engagement challenges and opportunities with our international colleagues will improve the overall quality of future activities conducted by our community of interest,"" said Licina.

273,PHC-P develops new Pre-Exercise Vector Surveillance program,"This spring, Public Health Command-Pacific’s Entomology and Environmental Molecular Biology Laboratory service lines will launch the first ever Pre-Exercise Vector Surveillance program for the Indo-Pacific region.

The new initiative is a pilot program funded by the Global Emerging Infectious Surveillance program, also known as GEIS, a section of the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch.

The vision of GEIS is to mitigate the threat of emerging infectious diseases to the U.S. military through a global laboratory network. The network is designed to help influence force health protection decision-making and enhance global health security.

One of the primary ways GEIS accomplishes this task is by providing timely, actionable infectious disease surveillance information to Geographic Combatant Commands and partner agencies, according to Maj. Michael Kwon, director of PHC-P's Environmental Health Services Directorate.

“This initiative acquires fresh data on health threats related to vector-borne diseases,” Kwon explained. “The goal is to provide combatant commanders with relevant intelligence on the prevalence of pathogens transmitted by arthropods, in order to make informed force health protection decisions.”

Typically, vector-borne disease data is collected by advance exercise parties as part of an occupational and environmental health site assessment, or OEHSA.

“Field parties put in the heroic effort to get checklists completed, but there are competing interests for time. Often individuals prioritize those tasks they are most versatile in,” explained Kwon. “Historically, environmental scientists focused on potable water, air sampling for industrial chemicals, or collected data on other health threats, and insufficient time is spent on trapping for vectors.”

Capt. John Eads, chief of entomology at Camp Zama, Japan, recognized these hindrances to achieving an accurate site picture, namely a lack of standardized methodology, inconsistent manpower or capabilities.

So, when he first joined the PHC-P team, he began to find ways to leverage the PHC-P entomology program to better fit the needs of the Army and DoD to keep service members safe from vector-borne diseases.

“When I first got here, the entomology program had potential to be more expansive, with a larger footprint than the local area,” explained Eads. “The vision is to build the program to collect more data, more information, and improve the site picture of what was going on within Indo-Pacific as far as vector surveillance and pathogen detection.

“You can see with the pandemic, how quickly a disease can spread. That same concept applies to vector-borne diseases,” Eads said. “For example, if there are Soldiers in the Philippines for an exercise who contract dengue [fever], they can transmit this to others. During peak mosquito season it could be just a matter of weeks before a traveler contracts the infection and perpetuates the cycle.”

In early 2020, Eads was invited to Hawaii to brief military leaders on the importance of understanding vector-borne disease threats.

Eads attended his first GEIS meeting during this trip, and learned about how GEIS contributes to the protection of DoD healthcare beneficiaries and the global community through an integrated worldwide emerging infectious disease surveillance system.

?“That’s where I was first introduced to GEIS and their mission and vision, and it seemed to line up perfectly with my concept of one team from all branches working together to produce the best vector-borne disease data,” he said.

Eads recognized the powerful potential for providing combatant commanders with actionable intelligence on disease threats for the different environmental terrains of the Indo-Pacific region.

To kick start the initiative, Eads reached out to other subject matter experts at the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, also known as AFRIMS, to devise ways to utilize GEIS to obtain funding and solve force health protection gaps.

By June 2020, Eads had received leadership buy-in, and several days later submitted his official GEIS proposal to partner with AFRIMS teammates.

“AFRIMS in Thailand specializes more in animals such as rodents, collecting the rodents for testing for leptospirosis and other pathogens that we don’t test for,” explained Eads. “[AFRIMS] has a lot of biologists, so by partnering with them we could add to our capabilities and help each other out. So we included them in our proposal to GEIS and they included us in theirs.”

One of the main objective of the PHC-P proposal was to standardize a surveillance program throughout the Indo-Pacific utilizing committed assets synchronized with GEIS, AFRIMS, and U.S. Army Pacific.

The goal is to capture population and activity data on vectors identified in the region and assess the presence and prevalence of pathogens in locations occupied by DoD personnel.

“We want to build joint knowledge products that can be used by both GEIS and combatant commanders,” said Eads. “Final products will be two different formats of scientific data, one for GEIS and the other is real-time health risk assessments for combatant commanders.”

By developing these products, Eads and AFRIMS will identify threat variables, not only for operational considerations but also for the development of integrated pest management programs.

Kwon said the information provided by the products will have wide-ranging applications.

“The data that is released by the Army and GEIS gets used by a lot of researchers and scientists,” he said. “A lot of people in public health career fields depend on having reliable data that is consistent.”

One of the ways the PHC-P Pre-Exercise Vector Surveillance program will accomplish consistent data collection is by standardizing equipment and developing standardized operating procedures using next generation sequencing.

Eads said much of the data they gather is difficult to analyze accurately.

”People don’t trap vectors the same,” he explained. “Some people might use one type of bait, others might not. They might trap in locations that we didn’t perceive is good locations. So, [the] first step is ensuring accurate data that we know was collected consistently by the same means - that is imperative.”

One of the ways Eads plans to standardize the PHC-P Pre-Exercise Vector Surveillance program this spring is by sending a team of two personnel from PHC-P to conduct surveillance with the same traps, using the same tactics, techniques and procedures.

To help with this process, the team will travel to several locations armed with new Nanopore MinION testing equipment.

Eads said the MinION provides consistent new real-time analysis, and since the equipment is portable, can test vectors in the field using rapid next-generation DNA and RNA sequencing.

“By having equipment such as the Nanopore MinION on ground before an exercise, we have the capability to conduct genomic identification of pathogens in real-time,” explained Eads.

“So, for example, if dengue is all of a sudden detected, but we weren’t expecting dengue to be in that area, we can then target our trapping techniques for dengue-vectoring mosquitoes. This helps to identify the risks and to help commanders make informed decisions and protect the force,” he said.

Gary Crispell, a microbiologist at the PHC-P EMBL at Camp Zama, said the new equipment means the future of disease surveillance will no longer be restricted to a laboratory.

“We are now able to conduct next generation sequencing from anywhere on the planet with a device small enough to fit in your backpack,” Crispell said. “These tools have only been around for a few years, but are being rapidly adopted for the scientific research community.”

Since next generation sequencing produces tremendous amounts of genomic data, the team will also use GEIS funding to hire a bioinformatics technician to target and identify critical patterns in the DNA and RNA of the vector samples.

“They filter through the information and find that proverbial needle in a haystack to send to GEIS,” explained Eads. “If you think about how much DNA makes up the human genome, it’s a pretty daunting task to analyze this information, even when dealing with insect and arthropod vectors.”

In addition to using the Nanopore MinION in the field, the team will also use the two PHC-P EMBLs at Camp Zama and Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington, to help process vectors when travel is not possible.

This capability allows the team to process larger amounts of vectors both for exercises and for routine installation surveillance, which can help more costumers understand what threats are in specific locations of interest.

“The DoD community should be aware of our laboratory assets at JBLM and Camp Zama,” said Kwon. “Entomologists and molecular biologists are staged to assist the community with force health protection consultations and analyses.

“Collaboration and relationships are force multipliers, and in the long run, it is good for science,” Kwon added.

The team will send its data to GEIS to assist in other research projects, and will also use it to provide expertise in pest management and program support to Installation Management Command-Pacific, Regional Health Command-Pacific, and field Preventive Medicine units in the Indo-Pacific region.

“By being on that cutting edge of science having the most up-to-date equipment, having SMEs [subject matter experts] in the field, and a bioinformatics technician, we will have the possibility to protect all DoD personnel throughout the region by identifying diseases or health risks before they become a problem,” said Eads.

As Pre-Exercise Vector Surveillance program moves forward during its pilot year, Eads and his team will test two locations this fiscal year to prove the proof of concept, while also developing standards and SOPs for future years.

By doing so, the team will lay the groundwork for a fully standardized vector surveillance program that the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command can use before key exercises to keep service members safe and healthy.

Eads and his efforts to launch the new Pre-Exercise Vector Surveillance program embraces the PHC-P credo of “100/0!” which means 100% accountability and responsibility, and zero excuses for not giving your best every day.

274,SFS captain wins Lance P. Sijan AFRC Leadership Award,"DOBBINS AIR RESERVE BASE, Ga. C During the Vietnam War, Capt. Lance P. Sijan, an Air Force Academy graduate and combat pilot, ejected from his disabled F-4C Phantom during a bombing mission in Laos. He evaded capture for more than six weeks, during which he experienced many hardships like shock and extreme weight loss from lack of food.

He was eventually captured by the North Vietnamese military, but not without a fight. Even in his weakened state, he was able to overpower one of the guards and make a temporary escape into the jungle before being captured again. At the prison camp, he was severely tortured during intense interrogations, but he refused to divulge any information to his captors.

He remained in captivity until his untimely death on January 22, 1968 when he contracted pneumonia shortly after being transported to the “Hanoi Hilton” prison camp in Vietnam.

Nearly a decade later, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by President Gerald Ford in recognition of his extraordinary heroism and courage that went above and beyond the call of duty. In 1991, the Air Force created the Lance P. Sijan USAF Leadership Award to further honor his legacy. 

Capt. Ryan Cheney, 94th Security Forces Squadron operations officer, was awarded the Sijan AFRC award this year in recognition of his exceptional leadership skills, which include managing a squadron of more than 50 security forces Airmen to protect nearly 6,000 base personnel.

“Hearing what the award was about and hearing about Lance P. Sijan and to be a nominee for any award that is dedicated to a leader of that caliber is really something,” said Cheney. “It’s an honor that anyone would look at me in that light.”

Cheney recognizes the unique challenges facing those who are in his charge. Due to the nature of the job, Defenders are required to work around the clock, in any weather, and any schedule, he said. Furthermore, as a newly-minted captain, he’s been a first lieutenant in a job that’s typically filled by a major.

“They’re really sacrificing so much,” Cheney explained. “An eight hour day isn’t an eight hour day for a Defender. It’s typically ten. A twelve hour day is the same. For a lot of them, they’ve already missed out on that time with their family.”

He credits his success as a leader to two things: one, getting to know his Airmen on a personal level, and two, offering them training opportunities to further advance their careers.

“Opportunity is the biggest thing,” Cheney said. “Some of our posts are really challenging, but if we focus on developing our Airmen and give them the opportunity to learn different aspects when we can, I think it’s a huge motivation factor.”

Cheney also finds motivation in leading his Airmen as well.

“They’re a great bunch,” said Cheney. “They’re hardworking and they’re professionals, and they’re in the eye of the entire wing every day. It’s just an honor to be part of that.”

His motivation doesn’t stop there though. He knows that winning the award isn’t the end goal. Rather than being complacent, he continues to strive toward becoming an even better leader for his Defenders.

“This has definitely been a vector check,” he said. “It makes me feel like I’m on the right path, but I’ve got a long way to go.”",2020/10/7,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/385534/sfs-captain-wins-lance-p-sijan-afrc-leadership-award,"GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佐治亚州,SFS队长获得Lance P.Sijan AFRC领导奖,佐治亚州多宾斯空军储备基地――越南战争期间，空军学院毕业生、战斗飞行员兰斯・P・西扬上尉在老挝执行轰炸任务时从残废的F-4C幻影中弹射出来。他逃避追捕长达六个多星期，其间他经历了许多困难，如休克和因缺乏食物而极度减肥。他最终被北越军队抓获，但并非没有战斗。即使在虚弱的状态下，他也能制服一名警卫，在再次被抓获之前暂时逃到丛林中。在集中营里，他在激烈的审讯中受到了严刑拷打，但他拒绝向逮捕他的人透露任何信息。他一直被囚禁，直到1968年1月22日被送往越南“河内希尔顿”集中营后不久感染肺炎，不合时宜地死亡。近十年后，他被杰拉尔德・福特总统追授荣誉勋章，以表彰他超乎职责范围的非凡英雄主义和勇气。1991年，美国空军设立了兰斯・P・西扬美国空军领导奖，以进一步表彰他的遗产。今年，安全部队第94中队作战官瑞安・切尼上尉获得了Sijan AFRC奖，以表彰他卓越的领导技能，其中包括管理一个由50多名安全部队飞行员组成的中队，以保护近6000名基地人员。切尼说：“听到这个奖项是关于什么的，听到兰斯・P・西扬的消息，成为任何奖项的提名人，都是为了纪念这样一位才华横溢的领袖，这真是一件了不起的事情。任何人都能从这个角度看待我，这是一种荣誉。”切尼认识到他所负责的人所面临的独特挑战。他说，由于这项工作的性质，防守队员必须在任何天气、任何日程安排下24小时不间断地工作。此外，作为一名新上任的上尉，他是一名中尉，通常由少校担任。“他们真的牺牲了很多，”切尼解释道。“一天八小时对一名防守队员来说不是一天八小时。通常是十小时。一天十二小时也是一样。对于很多人来说，他们已经错过了与家人在一起的时间。”他把自己作为领导者的成功归功于两件事：一是在个人层面上了解他的飞行员，二是为他们提供培训机会，进一步推进他们的职业生涯。“机会是最重要的，”切尼说。“我们的一些职位确实具有挑战性，但如果我们专注于培养我们的飞行员，并在可能的情况下给他们机会学习不同方面的知识，我认为这是一个巨大的激励因素。”切尼也在领导他的飞行员中找到了动力。“他们是一群很棒的人，”切尼说。“他们工作努力，是专业人士，他们每天都在整个联队的眼睛里。能成为其中的一员，我感到很荣幸。”然而，他的动机并不止于此。他知道获奖并不是最终目标。他并没有自满，而是继续努力成为防守队员更好的领导者。他说：“这绝对是一次矢量检查。这让我感觉我走在了正确的道路上，但我还有很长的路要走。”

276,‘Don’t Give Up’ campaign inspires P-S GAR Airmen,"SCHRIEVER AIR FORCE BASE, Colo. C Thirteen Peterson-Schriever Garrison Airmen displayed motivational words and handed out candy at the North gate at Schriever Air Force Base, Colorado as part of the ‘Don’t Give Up’ event Oct. 30. 

The event’s organizer, Master Sgt. Erin Kirby-Guanill, 21st Medical Squadron aerospace medicine flight chief, said ‘Don’t Give Up’ served as a reminder to Airmen and civilians that they’re loved and have a support system.  

Kirby-Guanill decided to implement the event here after hosting a similar event during her time at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico. 

“Getting out there and showing everybody we love them and we’re here for them is important to me,” she said.  

Kirby-Guanill’s nephew and sister both died by suicide and she said she understands how gestures of kindness can affect an individual. 
“I don’t ever want somebody’s family to go through what my family went through,” she said. 
Seeing Airmen and civilians smile and hearing them honk their horns in support of the display assured Kirby-Guanill how people appreciate their efforts.  

“We’ve done this twice and the first time, a lot of people went to the first sergeants who work in the [restricted area] and told them how wonderful [Don’t Give Up] was,” Kirby-Guanill said. “Someone stopped me in the hospital and said they appreciated us telling them good morning and he didn’t realize how much people need that sometimes.” 

Staff Sgt. Lathaniel Leigh, Schriever Chaplain Corps religious affairs Airman, said she was “eager” to participate in the campaign after hearing feedback from the first event held Sept. 29. 

Brief interactions with Team Schriever personnel prior to their work day beginning plays a vital role in their psyche as they work to complete the mission, Leigh said. 

“It takes a village to raise a child and I have the same mindset when it comes to caring for Airmen,” Leigh said. “My hope is [this] will encourage others to reach out if they are struggling.”

Kirby-Guanill plans to hold another gate event the week of Thanksgiving at Peterson Air Force Base and a holiday event here in December. 

“I feel like these events help me as much as they help others,” Kirby-Guanill said. “It’s so wonderful here because there’s no shortage of volunteers to help at the gates. The leadership on this base wants to be involved and show their support and I’m glad we’re able to help anyone who needs it.”",2020/10/30,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/382446/dont-give-up-campaign-inspires-p-s-gar-airmen,"COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国科罗拉多州斯普林斯,“不放弃”运动激励P-S GAR飞行员,科罗拉多州施里弗空军基地――10月30日，作为“不放弃”活动的一部分，13名彼得森・施里弗驻军空军在科罗拉多州施里弗空军基地的北门展示了励志口号并分发糖果。该活动的组织者、第21医疗中队航空航天医学飞行负责人、上士艾琳・柯比・瓜尼尔（Erin Kirby Guanill）说，“不要放弃”提醒飞行员和平民，他们是被爱的，有一个支持系统。Kirby Guanill在新墨西哥州阿尔伯克基的科特兰空军基地主持了一次类似的活动后，决定在这里实施这项活动。“走出去，向每个人展示我们爱他们，我们在这里支持他们，这对我来说很重要，”她说。Kirby Guanill的侄子和妹妹都死于自杀，她说她理解友善的姿态如何影响一个人。她说：“我不想让别人的家人经历我的家人所经历的一切。”。看到飞行员和平民微笑，听到他们鸣笛支持这次展示，柯比・瓜尼尔确信人们是多么感激他们的努力。Kirby Guanill说：“我们已经做了两次，第一次，很多人去找在（禁区）工作的上士，告诉他们（不要放弃）有多棒。”。“有人在医院拦住了我，说他们很感激我们告诉他们早上好，但他不知道人们有时有多需要这些。”施里弗牧师团宗教事务飞行员拉瑟尼尔・利上士说，她“渴望”在听取9月29日举行的第一次活动的反馈后，参加该活动。Leigh说，在工作日开始前与Schriever团队的工作人员进行简短的互动对他们完成任务的心理状态起着至关重要的作用。“养育一个孩子需要一个村庄，在照顾飞行员方面，我也有同样的想法，”利说。“我希望[这]能鼓励其他人在困难时伸出援助之手。”Kirby Guanill计划在感恩节这一周在彼得森空军基地举办另一场大门活动，并在12月在这里举办一场假日活动。Kirby Guanill说：“我觉得这些活动对我的帮助不亚于对其他人的帮助。”。“这里太棒了，因为不缺少志愿者在门口帮忙。这个基地的领导希望参与进来并表示支持，我很高兴我们能够帮助任何需要帮助的人。”
277,Airmen of 176th Wing nearly sweep Lance P. Sijan awards,"Airmen of 176th Wing nearly sweep Lance P. Sijan awards

By David Bedard
176th Wing Public Affairs

Airmen of 176th Wing nearly swept the 2020 Lance P. Sijan Leadership Award slate, taking three of four categories at the National Guard Bureau level.

Lt. Col. Jessica Pisano, 176th Maintenance Squadron commander, won the senior officer category; Capt. Matthew Soukup, 211th Rescue Squadron HC-130J Combat King II aircraft commander, won the junior officer category; and Master Sgt. Gary Keller, 176th Security Forces squad leader, won the senior NCO category.

The award recognizes the accomplishments of officers and noncommissioned officers who demonstrate the highest qualities of leadership in the performance of their duties and conduct of their lives. 

Captain Sijan was a 1965 Air Force Academy graduate and F-4 Phantom II pilot who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage while evading capture by the North Vietnamese and during his subsequent captivity as a prisoner of war.

According to Jessica Hair, NGB A-1 (Personnel) program manager for awards, as far as she knows, this is the first time a single Air National Guard wing has nearly swept the awards.

According to the nomination, as acting 176th MXS commander for four months before officially taking command, Pisano was responsible for providing maintenance support and generating 2,200 sorties comprising 8,000 flying hours, hauling more than 3,000 tons and moving more than 2,500 personnel, delivering 44 percent of the strategic airlift for U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.

Pisano enabled the nation’s busiest combat search and rescue fleet in support of Operation Noble Eagle and supported statewide civil search and rescue with 108 sorties comprising 215 hours with 76 lives saved.

Pisano’s leadership was instrumental to the generation of 10 C-17 Globemaster III special air missions for President Donald Trump, facilitating travel to the Koreas for nuclear non-proliferation negotiations with North Korea.

She deployed to the Horn of Africa in support of Operation Octave Shield where she supervised 51 maintenance Airmen supporting more than $125 million of equipment providing personnel recovery and casualty evacuation for an area of operations spanning millions of square miles.

As a volunteer, Pisano served as the vice president of the 176th Wing Squadron Commanders’ Council, mentoring 16 squadron commanders. She helped build cabins for the non-profit Battle Dawgs Wounded Warrior Camp, helping at least 20 wounded veterans.

According to Soukup’s nomination, he flew in support of Operation Inherent Resolve fighting ISIS, holding 350 alert hours and logged 50 combat hours, guaranteeing a persistent combat search and rescue presence throughout the region.

During Soukup’s 34 combat sorties, he flew 348 personnel and moved 51,000 pounds of cargo while providing personnel recovery coverage for 5,000 allied service members.

Notably, he flew the first combat medical evacuation for the unit, saving a life and demonstrating enhanced personnel recovery capabilities for the area of operations.

Soukup executed a complex aerial evacuation with minimal warning before an Iranian theater ballistic missile attack on the base, saving dozens of service members from the attack.

As a volunteer, Soukup served more than 1,000 meals in four days to the local community during COVID 19. He also fostered the future of aviation by providing flight instruction to the Cook Inlet Tribal Council Youth Employment Program.

According to Keller’s nomination, while deployed to Afghanistan he established improved procedures for eight Kandahar Airfield defense areas, improving fortifications and increasing defensive posture by 100 percent. Keller revamped the contracting office representative program, reworking two one-year $43.5 million contracts for a private security contractor comprising more than 100 security personnel.

Keller developed standard operating procedures for the transfer of equipment to the Afghan National Army, and he secured movement by a Romanian government agency for allied equipment.

He reacted to three rocket attacks and led the base quick reaction force, clearing several taxiways and hundreds of aircraft, protecting 10,000 allied personnel and $3.5 billion in assets.

Keller led 2019 Defender Ace annual training exercise, logging more than 9,000 training hours preparing 176th SFS to defeat near-peer threats.

During his deployment, Keller volunteered scarce off-duty hours to augment the chaplaincy, helping to ensure religious support for more than 1,200 Airmen.

Col. Anthony Stratton, 176th Wing commander, said he is proud three wing Airmen earned the exclusive leadership award at the national level, but he isn’t surprised.

278,What the hail? P-S GAR JA can offer help,"In the past two months, Schriever and Peterson Air Force Bases experienced hail storms in which members’ vehicles were damaged.

In many cases, the damages were destructive enough for members to file claims with their private insurance providers. To help those in need, the Peterson-Schriever Garrison legal team is working to help members, who qualify, to file a claim with the Air Force.

“After receiving a settlement, or if [the member has] liability only, no comprehensive coverage, a claim can be filed with the Claims Service Center,” said Capt. Kelly Fennel, P-S GAR Judge Advocate Office chief of civil law.

Eligible members who are able to make a claim through the AF include:

Active duty Department of the Air Force personnel.
Retired or separated Air Force military personnel who suffer loss or damage resulting from the last entitled storage or movement of their personal property.
Air Force Reserve Command and Air National Guard personnel for an incident that occurs while they are performing federally funded active duty, inactive duty for training, or full-time National Guard duty.
ANG technicians under Title 32 USC § 709.
Civilian employees whom the Air Force pays from appropriated funds.
Civilian employees of the Defense Commissary Agency who work on an Air Force installation.
DoD Dependent School teachers and administrative personnel employed at schools on or serviced by Air Force installations.
AF Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets while traveling at Government expense or on active duty for summer training.
US Air Force Academy cadets.
Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality employees are not proper claimants under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees’ Claims Act. However, such claims are accepted and processed consistent with this Instruction and forwarded to the NAFI for action.
Members may begin their claims at https://claims.jag.af.mil/. Contact the P-S GAR JA for the specific log in information.

Upon starting the claim, members should be prepared to provide the following:

A statement from the member’s supervisor stating they were on duty at the time of the storm. Other documents required are vehicle registration, insurance documentation and a receipt showing the member paid a repair company for their deductible.

“It is very important to keep your documentation related to the storm,” Fennel said. “If you have liability only, you must upload a copy of your Insurance Policy Declarations page showing your coverage and a receipt showing repairs were paid for.”

After the claim is made, the Air Force Claims Service Center will either offer a settlement for the deductible or deny the claim.

“If a settlement is offered, it may be for either the full amount or a partial amount,” Fennel said. “It is the member’s decision on whether to accept the offer or appeal it.”

If a member was put in a difficult financial situation due to the damage that occurred, they may receive help through the Air Force Aid Society. The amount of money loaned out is different based on the needs of the member and other factors.

“The Air Force Aid Society gives out interest free loans based on a case-by-case scenario,” said Lenea Lance, Airman and Family Readiness Center certified personal financial counselor.

To check who qualifies for the loan and for more information on the loan and other financial aid resources, contact Lance at 567-3920.

The Washington Air National Guard sent eight marksmen from the Western Air Defense Sector, 194th Wing and 141st Air Refueling Wing to the Winston P. Wilson Championship in Little Rock, Ark., April 7-10, 2019.

The Winston P. Wilson (WPW) Championship is an annual marksmanship competition help by the National Guard Marksmanship Training Center.  Teams from every state, as well as a hand full of international teams, gather at Robinson Maneuver Training Center to compete for honors.  For five days, teams were mentally and physically challenged on three ranges with over a dozen courses of fire. 

WPW is not only about competition.  The focus is really on training.  You will find some of the best marksman in the world mixed in with those who are brand new to the game.  No matter their current level, every participant learns valuable skills to enhance their shooting proficiency.  Strangers work together as a team.  A community is formed, and those more experienced provide good mentoring.  

“The one thing I really appreciated was receiving advice from someone on another team.  We were there to compete against each other, but there was a sense of camaraderie and the willingness to help each other out,” said Mast Sgt. Ryan Rathbun, 194th Medical Group.

As the Washington National Guard continues to build the foundation for the state’s Marksmanship Training Program more opportunities like this will be announced by Joint Tasking Orders.  The selection process for next years’ WPW teams should start before the end of the year.

280,Bataan Sailor Receives 2019 Regina P. Mills Leadership Award,"When walking down the passageways of the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD 5), you pass many faces, but there is one face you can always count on to be wearing a smile, Aviation Boatswain’s Mate (Fuel)  2nd Class Gillian Zamora, this year’s recipient of the Aviation Boatswain's Mate Association and Commander, Naval Air Force Atlantic Fleet’s  Lt. Cmdr. Regina P. Mills Leadership Award.

Every year the Aviation Mate Association recognizes two Sailors from the Aviation Boatswain’s Mate community who they feel best embody the spirit of Lt. Cmdr. Regina P. Mills. Mills enlisted in the Navy as an Aviation Boatswain’s Mate and later earned a commission as an aircraft handling officer. She served as the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72) first female aircraft handling officer successfully leading one of the largest departments onboard.  Mills was killed in 2012, after being struck by a vehicle when she stopped to assist others involved in a traffic collision in Gig Harbor, Wash.

“Regina was always such a caring person,” said Senior Chief Aviation Boatswain’s Mate (Fuel) Hawa Riley, Zamora’s Leading Chief Petty Officer. “So after her death, the Aviation Boatswain’s Community thought it would be fitting to create this leadership award in her honor. She was a great leader, a great handler, a great air boss; pretty much everything about Regina Mills was great. This honor doesn’t even touch an inch of what she really was, however this is the best we could do to honor her by recognizing Sailors who are great leaders like she always was.

For Zamora, this award is a lot more than just a piece of paper and a pat on the back. “I feel honored and humbled,” shared Zamora. “I’m honored because it means that someone took the time out to recognize that I’m doing what I’m supposed to do, and I’m humbled because the award is in honor of such an influential person in the [Aviation Boatswain’s Mate] community.”

According to Riley, Zamora has taken on difficult duties throughout her career and built a reputation of excellence that follows her wherever she goes.

Riley who nominated Zamora for the award worked with her at Recruit Training Command, “I saw her work ethic there,” said Riley. “So when I saw her onboard the Bataan, I already knew I had a strong second class to lead the division, and she has set the standard since day one.”

Zamora attributes her success to always trying to remember her “why,” which is her fundamental desire to always continue bettering herself. “On my bad days I remember that my Sailors need me,” said Zamora. “They are my reason to keep going. Because if I stop doing what I have to do, what is going to drive them to do better?”
 	
For Zamora, bad days are vital to growth.

“It’s not as easy as it seems,” said Zamora. “There are struggles; it’s all about how you overcome them. There are going to be good days and bad days, but it’s important that you use those struggles as stepping stones to self-improvement.”

A Regina P. Mills Leadership recipient must have demonstrated exceptional leadership skills, a strong work ethic, dedication to duty and contributed to improving the ABF community. Which Zamora has demonstrated all throughout her Navy career and especially since 2017 while aboard the Bataan.  Zamora says she has learned to lead by watching other strong females in the Navy. 

“When I joined the Navy, I guess I was lucky, I always seemed to have good leadership from the start,” said Zamora. “At my first command, I met my first female Master Chief and I told myself that I would like to be like her or at least copy some of her characteristics.”

Zamora’s attitude, leadership, and experiences have all culminated in a second class more than worthy of the Regina P. Mills Leadership Award, according to Riley.

“Winning the award really reaffirmed everything we already knew about her as a great leader,” said Riley. “So when she won this award, it wasn’t a surprise; it was a confirmation that everyone else in the Aviation Boatswain’s Mate community saw that this girl deserved some recognition.”",2019/7/3,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/330280/bataan-sailor-receives-2019-regina-p-mills-leadership-award,"NORFOLK, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国弗吉尼亚州诺福克,巴丹水手获得2019年里贾纳・P・米尔斯领导力奖,当走在两栖攻击舰USS Bataan（LHD 5）的通道上时，你会经过许多面孔，但有一张脸你总是可以指望面带微笑，航空水手长的大副（燃料）二等吉利安・萨莫拉，今年航空水手长大副协会的接受者和指挥官，海军空军大西洋舰队的雷吉纳・P・米尔斯少校领导奖。每年，航空伴侣协会都会表彰两名来自航空水手长伴侣社区的水手，他们认为他们最能体现雷吉纳・P・米尔斯少校的精神。米尔斯在海军服役，担任航空水手长的助手，后来获得了飞机操纵官的任命。她曾担任美国航空母舰亚伯拉罕・林肯号（CVN 72）的第一位女性飞机操纵官，成功领导了船上最大的部门之一。2012年，米尔斯在华盛顿州吉格港（Gig Harbor）的一次交通事故中停下来协助他人时被一辆汽车撞死。高级首席航空水手长的助手（燃料）哈瓦・赖利（Hawa Riley）说：“里贾娜一直是一个很有爱心的人。”。“所以在她死后，航空水手长的社区认为为她设立这个领导奖是合适的。她是一个伟大的领袖，一个伟大的管理者，一个伟大的空中老板；关于里贾娜・米尔斯的几乎所有事情都是伟大的。这个荣誉甚至没有触及她真正的身份，但这是我们所能做的最好的。”通过表彰像她一直以来都是伟大领袖的水手来向她致敬。对萨莫拉来说，这个奖项不仅仅是一张纸和拍拍后背。“我感到荣幸和谦卑，”萨莫拉分享道。“我很荣幸，因为这意味着有人花时间承认我在做我应该做的事情，我很谦卑，因为这个奖项是为了纪念[航空水手长的伙伴]社区中如此有影响力的人。”据赖利说，萨莫拉在她的职业生涯中承担了艰巨的任务，并建立了卓越的声誉，无论她走到哪里都会追随她。提名萨莫拉获奖的赖利在新兵训练司令部与她一起工作，“我看到了她的职业道德，”赖利说。“因此，当我看到她在巴丹号上时，我已经知道我有一个强大的二等舱来领导这个师，她从第一天起就树立了标准。”萨莫拉将她的成功归因于总是试图记住她“为什么”，这是她不断提高自己的基本愿望。“在我糟糕的日子里，我记得我的水手需要我。”萨莫拉说：“他们是我继续前进的理由。因为如果我停止做我必须做的事情，什么会促使他们做得更好？”对萨莫拉来说，糟糕的日子对成长至关重要。“这不像看上去那么容易，”萨莫拉说。“有挣扎；这都是关于你如何克服它们。有好的日子也有坏的日子，但重要的是你要把这些挣扎作为自我提升的垫脚石。”里贾纳・P・米尔斯（Regina P.Mills）的领导力接受者必须表现出卓越的领导技能、强烈的职业道德、敬业精神，并为改善ABF社区做出了贡献。萨莫拉在其海军生涯中，尤其是2017年在巴丹号上时，都表现出了这一点。萨莫拉说，她通过观看其他战机学会了领导海军中的坚强女性。“当我加入海军时，我想我很幸运，我从一开始就似乎有很好的领导能力，”萨莫拉说。“在我的第一次指挥中，我遇到了我的第一位女总司令，我告诉自己，我想像她一样，或者至少模仿她的一些特征。”莱利说，萨莫拉的态度、领导力和经验都达到了二等奖的顶峰，远远超过了里贾纳・P・米尔斯领导力奖。“获奖确实再次证明了我们对她作为一位伟大领袖的了解，”莱利说。“因此，当她获得这个奖项时，这并不令人惊讶；这是一个确认，航空水手长同伴社区的所有其他人都认为这个女孩应该得到一些认可。”

PREPARE: To prepare for a telephone call, you should write a script and practice it. Have notes prepared for referencing. Be prepared to leave a message if the person is not available. In preparing for an in-person meeting, follow the same steps for a phone interview. Research the company before the interview to be prepared to ask and answer questions.

PRACTICE: Practice what you want to say over and over. The more you hear yourself say what you want to say, the more confident you will feel. Smile while on the phone. People can hear confidence and determine friendliness from the tone of your voice. Fear can be heard over the phone, too. Concentrate on speaking clearly, be calm, and breathe! Prepare for one-on-one meetings by practicing with someone you know and trust. Asking them to role-play with you is a great way to prepare for the real interview.

PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER: Part of feeling confident is feeling good about yourself. Feeling good about your appearance tends to give your confidence a boost! Good grooming is the first step. Don’t wear too much perfume or cologne as sometimes people are allergic C and wearing too much will make them remember you because of your smell, not for your skills.

282,RHC-P flexes disaster response capabilities during RIMPAC 2018,"FORD ISLAND, Hawaii (July, 12, 2018) C The Pacific is a hotbed for natural disasters, ranging from earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons, and floods. Maintaining and enhancing humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HA/DR) capabilities is vital to the stability of the region and requires close work with U.S., international partner governments and private sector agencies. 

The U.S. Navy’s Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC) exercise, accomplishes just that C bringing together key players in complex scenarios in the world’s largest international maritime exercise. 

During the biennial exercise, 25 nations, 46 surface ships, five submarines, 17 national land forces, and more than 200 aircraft and 25,000 personnel test a wide range of capabilities ranging from disaster relief and maritime security operations to sea control and complex warfighting. 

Regional Health Command-Pacific (RHC-P), the Army’s medical directorate in a geographically diverse area of operation, is participating in the HA/DR statewide medical response portion of the exercise, which runs July 9-17, and is designed to enhance operability, test communication and exercise crisis response capabilities amongst interagency partners.  

“A lot of people unfortunately think RIMPAC is just a war exercise and that’s not all it does. It does so much more. The humanitarian assistance disaster relief part is big. This gives us a chance to practice as a statewide organization to work with our partners and assets that we really don’t have access to outside of RIMPAC,” said Chris Crabtree, Hawaii Healthcare Emergency Management Coalition director, who is also the lead for the 50 bed hospital system during RIMPAC. 

A wide community of interest validates participants from the United Nations, various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and academia, and aids Hawaii-based Department of Defense and medical facilities in their statewide mass casualty drills and certifications. 

“This is the 26th iteration of RIMPAC and every year we keep getting better and better,” said RHC-P Emergency Manager and RIMPAC lead, Tom Bookman. “This isn’t a tabletop exercise. We are actually operating aeromedical, ground and sea patient movements to 27 military and civilian hospitals spread out across six Hawaii islands and over to Washington State as well,” Bookman said.   

In addition to the Ford Island exercise action, Federal Coordinating Centers at Madigan Army Medical Center, located at Joint Base Lewis McChord, as well as Tripler Army Medical Center, in Hawaii, actively participated with receiving patient actors at emergency departments at each location, to include U.S. Army Health Clinic-Schofield Barracks, in Hawaii. “It’s impressive to see the skills being displayed as our Army medical professionals respond to realistic mock mass casualties, aftershocks, extensive infrastructure damage and beyond,” Bookman said. “We hope to never have to use this training but the reality is, given the climate in the Pacific, it’s not a matter of if a natural disaster will impact the Pacific but when,” he added. 

Bookman also reiterated the importance of maintaining relationships with the State of Hawaii, sister services, and the international community. “We aren’t waiting until an actual disaster before we start forging and reinforcing working relationships. We are doing that now because if you wait…it’s too late and lives can be lost” he added. 
 
Crabtree echoed those sentiments emphasizing the challenge living on an island brings to disaster response. “Should the worst happen, you are never going to have enough supplies. No matter how much you stockpile. If a real world event cuts off our supply chain, we are on our own for healthcare. Through the coalition, which consists of over 160 healthcare organizations statewide, to include Regional Health Command-Pacific, we are able to leverage all of our resources together to support the system as a whole to minimize the impact on the community. That’s part of what we are working through here,” Crabtree added. 

Crabtree also assessed that the exercise would yield ongoing benefits for years to come. “This gives us a chance to take our plan and break it so we can see where the weak points are and fix it. Then it’s that much better so if a real event does occur we are ready or more ready than before,” said Crabtree. 

This is also the first year that Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT), local level response efforts located in Ewa Beach and Kailua, participated in RIMPAC. Due to the fact that the communities were cut off by road during the simulated disaster, exercise planners wanted to include those CERTs into the medical scenario. ""We coordinated with the Hawaii Park System to fly military helicopters to Ewa Beach and Kailua parks to recover mock casualties from these two locations via military helicopters. The local CERT teams conducted both triage and treatments on the ground,"" Bookman said.

VMGR-152 and the 160th SOAR performed an MH-60 Black Hawk helicopter air-to-air refueling in the night at low altitude with covert aircraft lighting, aided with night vision imaging systems. The units accomplished their mission in order to maintain effective training while maximizing combat capabilities.

“Army 160th are the best of the best helicopter pilots, and working with them always makes us better,” said U.S. Marine Corps Capt. Donald Shrewsbury, a KC-130J Hercules pilot with VMGR-152. “160th SOAR is a huge aviation unit across the Army. They have multiple platforms that we can refuel. We have to work with them so they can stay proficient at tanking, and we can stay proficient at helping them out.”

Although air-to-air refueling is standard training for VMGR-152, conducting it at night enhances the Marine’s capabilities to work and execute proficiently under challenging circumstances.

“There’s a different aspect when the sun goes down, and without the use of night vision it can get scary out there,” said U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sgt. Paul Folk, a crewmaster with VMGR-152. “If we can’t see, neither can the enemy. We do night systems training to be able to operate in an environment that keeps us more camouflaged from the enemy’s sight.”

Night helicopter air-to-air refueling is one of many exercises that VMGR-152 now has the opportunity to conduct as a result of El Centro Horizon.

The exercise provided the unit and the Marines who participated the unique experience of combining three different aspects of training C performing aerial refueling, low visibility conditions and with another service branch C each of which is essential to maintaining the Marine Corps’ place as the most elite fighting force in the world.

“War doesn’t have a time frame. War is 24/7,” said Folk. “We have to be able to operate in any environment. That’s why we do what we do.”",2017/12/6,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/258132/sumos-soar-with-160-nighttime-aerial-refueling,"EL CENTRO, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],EL CENTRO，加利福尼亚州，美国,相扑猛增160米夜间空中加油,2017年12月6日，美国海军陆战队与海军空中加油运输中队（VMGR）152在加利福尼亚州海军航空设施El Centro进行了名为El Centro Horizon的部队级训练，期间与美国陆军第160特种作战航空团进行了联合空中训练任务。VMGR-152和第160架SOAR直升机在夜间低空执行MH-60黑鹰直升机空对空加油，飞机隐蔽照明，夜视成像系统辅助。这些部队完成了任务，以便在保持有效训练的同时最大限度地提高作战能力。“第160军是最好的直升机飞行员中的佼佼者，与他们合作总是让我们变得更好，”美国海军陆战队上校唐纳德・什鲁斯伯里（Donald Shrewsbury）说，他是VMGR-152的KC-130J大力士飞行员。“第160滑翔机是一支庞大的陆军航空部队。他们有多个平台，我们可以为他们加油。我们必须与他们合作，以便他们能够熟练地加油，我们也能够熟练地帮助他们。”尽管空对空加油是VMGR-152的标准训练，在夜间执行此任务可提高海军陆战队在挑战性环境下的工作能力和熟练执行能力。VMGR-152的机长、美国海军陆战队炮兵中士保罗・福克（Paul Folk）说：“当太阳落下时，情况会有所不同，如果不使用夜视系统，可能会让人感到恐惧。”。“如果我们看不见，敌人也看不见。我们进行夜间系统训练，以便能够在更隐蔽的环境中操作，使我们不被敌人看到。”夜间直升机空对空加油是VMGR-152现在有机会在El Centro Horizon上进行的众多演习之一。该演习为部队和海军陆战队提供了独特的经验，他们将训练的三个不同方面结合起来――空中加油，低能见度条件下，与另一个兵种作战――每一个兵种都是维持海军陆战队作为世界上最精锐战斗力量地位的关键。“战争没有时间限制。战争是全天候的，”福克说。“我们必须能够在任何环境下运营。这就是我们为什么要这么做的原因。”

286,Rear Adm. Luchtman Relieves Rear Adm. Leavitt at Naval Safety Center Change of Command,"NORFOLK, Va. (April 28, 2020) C Rear Adm. Fredrick R. Luchtman relieved Rear Adm. Mark L. Leavitt as commander, Naval Safety Center (NAVSAFECEN), in a change of command ceremony, April 28.
Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Robert P. Burke, presided over the ceremony. Only family members and NAVSAFECEN’s executive staff attended in person at its Naval Station Norfolk headquarters in consideration of COVID-19 restrictions.
Luchtman comes to NAVSAFECEN from leading the Navy’s Physiological Episodes Action Team (PEAT) that investigates and studies the effects on pilot and aircrew performance when an aircraft or aircrew system malfunctions during flight. Physiological episodes are the number one safety concern for Naval Aviation, making its studies relevant to NAVSAFECEN.
“This is an exciting time to be at the Naval Safety Center. The fleet depends on us to provide useful data and lessons learned so that we can make mishap-preventing decisions,” Luchtman said. “The Naval Safety Center will continue to build a proactive culture of risk identification and management to achieve zero preventable mishaps.”
Luchtman, a Naval Aviator and a 1989 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy, has over 4,000 hours in F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornets. He commanded Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 15 and Carrier Air Wing (CVW) Seven. He participated in Operations Southern Watch, Deny Flight, Deliberate Force, Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom and Inherent Resolve. Luchtman holds a master of arts in national security and strategic studies from the Naval War College. He has led the PEAT since 2018.
Leavitt, who was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal by Burke, retires after 38 years in the Navy and Naval Reserves. Leavitt revitalized NAVSAFECEN, changing it from a rudimentary mishap data repository to a forward-looking organization that provides advanced analytics, sophisticated modeling and timely risk assessments that can be used to prevent future mishaps.
“I am proud to have served the Navy, and especially the Naval Safety Center,” Leavitt said. “I have had the privilege and honor to serve alongside the Sailors, Marines and civilians who work to ensure we reduce mishaps and hazards. As I leave, I charge every member of the Naval Safety Center team with continuing to build a culture of excellence where safety and professionalism are at the forefront of everything we do.”
Leavitt, also a Naval Aviator, accumulated over 5,000 hours in multiple naval aircraft. He has held five commands, including an aviation squadron, several operational units and a joint command.  Additionally, he served as deputy Reserve component commander, Navy Region Midwest.

In October 2011, Leavitt was promoted to flag rank.

287,Rear Adm. Tom Anderson Visits SERMC,"MAYPORT, FL (NNS) -- Commander, Navy Regional Maintenance Center (CNRMC) and Naval Sea Systems (NAVSEA) Deputy Commander, Ship Maintenance and Modernization (SEA 21) Rear Adm. Tom Anderson, visited Southeast Regional Maintenance Center (SERMC) in Mayport, Fla. July 9-10.

Since assuming command of CNRMC on May 31, Anderson has made it a priority to meet with as many RMC Sailors and Civilians within his first 90 days. Anderson met with executive leadership to discuss his guiding principles, conducted a Navy Afloat Maintenance Training Strategy (NAMTS) certificate presentation and engaged with Sailors and Civilians from each shop and department during a tour of the facility. The visit also included “Coffee with the Chief’s Mess” where he shared his guiding principles and had a question and answer session, and concluded with tours of local contractor facilities.

During the presentation of the NAMTS certificates, Anderson stressed the importance of the program. NAMTS is a NAVSEA initiative designed to improve maintenance capability and self-sufficiency at sea through on-the-job training while earning Naval Enlisted Classifications (NEC’s) on shore duty. Most Sailors at SERMC will return to sea and become a force multiplier by training other Sailors to sustain their systems and equipment while on deployment or engaged in combat. 

“At some point, you’re going to go back to sea and you will apply the expertise you’ve acquired here,” Anderson told Sailors who recently earned NAMTS NECs. “You need to be a forceful advocate for what you’ve learned. When something breaks at sea and you feel you’ve got the capability to fix it, you should pipe up and say ‘I got it!’” Anderson said.
 
“A couple of things will happen when you do that,” Anderson continued. “First, the rest of the crew will start to gain confidence in their ability to fix their equipment at sea; second, people who don’t know about the NAMTS program will become educated about it; and third, you become more proficient as a unit so when something does go wrong you are able to fix it quickly and properly.”

“Right now there is almost no place to get that type of experience except at a Regional Maintenance Center. That’s why your time here is important to the Navy and it benefits you, personally,” Anderson concluded.

CNRMC is a NAVSEA field activity and oversees the operations of Regional Maintenance Centers in their execution of surface ship maintenance and modernization. SEA 21 is the dedicated life cycle management organization for the Navy's in-service surface ships and is responsible for managing critical modernization, maintenance, training and inactivation programs.",2019/7/9,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/331392/rear-adm-tom-anderson-visits-sermc,"MAYPORT, FL, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佛罗里达州梅波特,陆军后方司令汤姆・安德森访问SERMC,佛罗里达州梅波特（NNS）――海军区域维修中心（CNRMC）指挥官和海军海上系统（NAVSEA）副指挥官、船舶维修和现代化（Sea 21）后方海军上将汤姆・安德森于7月9日至10日访问了位于佛罗里达州梅波特的东南区域维修中心（SERMC）。自5月31日担任CNRMC指挥以来，安德森把在头90天内会见尽可能多的RMC水手和平民作为优先事项。安德森会见了执行领导，讨论了他的指导原则，进行了海军海上维修培训战略（NAMTS）证书颁发，并在参观设施期间与各商店和部门的水手和平民进行了接触。访问还包括“与酋长餐厅一起喝咖啡”，在那里他分享了他的指导原则，并进行了问答，最后参观了当地承包商的设施。在颁发NAMTS证书期间，安德森强调了该项目的重要性。NAMTS是一项NAVSEA计划，旨在通过在职培训提高海上维修能力和自给自足能力，同时获得海军陆上勤务兵种（NEC）。SERMC的大多数水手将返回海上，通过训练其他水手在部署或参与战斗时维持其系统和设备，成为部队倍增器。安德森对最近获得NAMTS NEC的水手们说：“在某个时候，你将回到海上，你将应用你在这里获得的专业知识。”。安德森说：“你需要成为你所学知识的有力倡导者。当某些东西在海上断裂，你觉得自己有能力修复它时，你应该大声说‘我找到了！’”。安德森继续说：“当你这样做的时候，会发生一些事情。”。“首先，其他船员将开始对他们在海上修理设备的能力有信心；其次，不了解NAMTS计划的人将接受有关该计划的教育；第三，作为一个整体，你将变得更加熟练，因此当出现问题时，你能够快速、正确地修理它。”“现在，除了在地区维修中心，几乎没有地方可以获得这种经验。这就是为什么你在这里的时间对海军很重要，而且对你个人也有好处。”Anderson总结道，CNRMC是NAVSEA的一项现场活动，负责监督区域维修中心在水面舰艇维修和现代化过程中的运作。SEA 21是海军现役水面舰艇的专用生命周期管理组织，负责管理关键的现代化、维修和维修染色和灭活程序。
288,"CSG-10 Bids Farewell to Rear Adm. Paparo, Welcomes Rear Adm. Meier during Change of Command","Rear Adm. John Meier relieved Rear Adm. Sam Paparo as commander of Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 10 during a ceremony here March 29.

Adm. Phil Davidson, commander of U.S. Fleet Forces, served as the ceremony's guest speaker and presiding officer, presenting Paparo with the Legion of Merit.

Under Paparo, CSG-10 assisted with the training of units worldwide through a variety of exercise events. His forces provided realistic and meaningful training for units deploying overseas.
Davidson noted the many challenges facing the Navy and said in order to counter them all, the watchword for naval forces has to be readiness.

“This strike group has been deeply involved in creating that readiness. If we can’t execute (missions) robustly, if we can’t execute it on time, it’s a limitation to our abilities. The focus of this strike group during this period had been incredibly important,” he said.

Additionally, the strike group led a task force that took part in Defense Support to Civilian Authorities (DSCA) operations following Hurricane Irma hitting Florida in September. Embarked aboard USS Iwo Jima (LHD 7), Paparo utilized elements of Amphibious Squadron (PHIBRON) 4; USS San Jacinto (CG 56); Explosive Ordinance Disposal Group (EODGRU) 2; Tactical Air Control Squadron (TACRON)  22; Fleet Surgical Team (FST) 8; the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit; Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron (HMH) 461; Marine Air Control Group (MACG) 28; Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC) 28; Fleet Survey Team; Beach Master Unit (BMU) 2; Naval Beach Group (NBG) 2; Amphibious Construction Battalion (ACB) 2; Assault Craft Unit (ACU) 2; and Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit (CBMU) 202, detachment Jacksonville. 

The task force enabled the flow of state and federal aid by restoring the airfield and flight operations at Naval Air Station Key West, restored access to Truman Annex boat ramps - allowing for LCU operations C and cleared roads to a major fuel delivery point.  They also assisted with repairs to water distribution systems at Naval Air Station Key West and restored electrical generation and air conditioning to vital buildings on military and civilian buildings. He partnered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and with state and local officials until civilian authorities and the Florida National Guard could take over long-term recovery operations.

“During the worst hurricane season anyone can remember, the incredible support you provided down in the Florida Keys exemplifies the capabilities and dedication of the strike group,” Davidson said, addressing the assembled staff. “A rapid ringing of a bell and a quick rush to a ship that you had not been aboard before and off to do the mission, and I personally thank you for the time you spent on station. You did an amazing job.”

Paparo thanked his staff for their professionalism and the warfare commanders under him for their expertise and counsel during his tour.

The staff, he said, are, “75 people who are experts in their skillsets, and who come together as a team to put vectors against targets.”

Of the warfare commanders, Paparo noted, “You’re who makes the engine go and it was a blessing to serve with you.”

Paparo, a native of Morton, Penn., will next report as the director of operations for U.S. Central Command at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. 

Meier comes to CSG-10 following a tour as the assistant commander, Navy Personnel Command for Career Management (PERS-4). The Export, Penn., native graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1986. He previously commanded the pre-commissioning unit for USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), as well as Electronic Attack Squadron (VAQ) 136 and USS Gunston Hall (LSD 44). In his remarks, Meier said he was eager to continue the work to ready the strike group as it moves into the training phase of the Optimized Fleet Response Plan (OFRP). 

“It is, in fact, all about readiness,” Meier said. “When we go to sea, our lean has got to be, ‘we aren’t planning for some deployment down the road, we are preparing to go to war.’ The sooner we take that mindset, the more we’ll be ready when that day comes.” 

CSG-10 consists of the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D.

289,Adm. Michelle Howard recognizes APUS Graduates,"WASHINGTON - Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) Adm. Michelle Howard addressed an audience of more than 3,500 during the 2015 American Public University System (APUS) commencement ceremony at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland, June 13.

Howard applauded the graduates' accomplishments and acknowledged the difficulties of completing an online degree.

""You have just completed a college degree completely online,"" said Howard. ""All while holding down a job, or raising a family, or living a life outside your virtual campus. The experience of researching, learning, and collaborating through a fully virtual world provides you with unique skills beyond those of your counterparts at a traditional brick-and-mortar institution.""

APUS was established in 1991 and is an online learning institution composed of the American Military University (AMU) and the American Public University (APU). The university system currently enrolls more than 100,000 students. Fifty-eight percent of students are active-duty military, guard, reserve, or veteran; 42 percent are civilian. 

Students from all 50 states and more than 100 countries attend the online school.

Initially, the main goal of APUS was to meet the unique educational needs of military personnel needing courses in specialized areas, such as counter terrorism and military intelligence that were not included in typical university course offerings.

Howard likened the graduates' path to that of a pioneer in the 1971 computer game, The Oregon Trail. 

""Many of you were among the first to enjoy learning on a computer -- whether you knew it then or not, you were pioneers,"" said Howard. ""To succeed on your journey, you must have the courage to make a decision. At APU and AMU, you had to display discipline, stamina, and downright tenacity at times in order to make it through. As pioneers in a global, interconnected world, your possible destinations are limitless."" 

She went on to encourage the graduates to use their education to better themselves and to help those around them. 

""You have earned your degree and now look to the future,"" said Howard. ""Keep the path open so that others may follow. As a veteran of the trailhead, you now can serve as a guide. Help the next generation of educational trailblazers that are following in your footsteps. Show them the way -- you are still pioneers.""",2015/6/13,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/166702/adm-michelle-howard-recognizes-apus-graduates,"WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国华盛顿特区,米歇尔・霍华德上将表彰APUS毕业生,华盛顿―海军作战部副部长（VCNO）上将米歇尔・霍华德（Michelle Howard）在马里兰州国家港口盖洛德国家度假村和会议中心举行的2015年美国公立大学系统（APUS）开工典礼上向3500多名听众发表了讲话，6月13日。霍华德赞扬了毕业生的成就，并承认完成在线学位的困难。“你刚刚完成了一个完全在线的大学学位，”霍华德说。“在工作、家庭生活或虚拟校园外生活的同时。通过完全虚拟的世界进行研究、学习和协作的体验，为您提供了传统实体机构同行无法比拟的独特技能。”APU成立于1991年，是由美国军事大学（AMU）和美国公立大学（APU）组成的在线学习机构。大学系统目前招收了10多万名学生。58%的学生是现役军人、警卫、预备役或退伍军人；42%是平民。来自所有50个州和100多个国家的学生都参加了在线学校。最初，APUS的主要目标是满足需要专业领域课程的军事人员的独特教育需求，霍华德将这些毕业生的道路比作1971年电脑游戏《俄勒冈小径》的先驱。霍华德说：“你们中的许多人都是最早喜欢在电脑上学习的人――不管你们当时是否知道，你们都是先驱。”。“要想在旅途中取得成功，你必须有勇气做出决定。在APU和AMU，你必须时不时地表现出纪律、毅力和彻底的坚韧，才能成功。作为全球互联世界的先驱，你可能的目的地是无限的。”她继续鼓励毕业生利用他们所受的教育提高自己，帮助周围的人。霍华德说：“你已经获得了学位，现在展望未来。”。“保持道路畅通，让其他人可以跟随。作为先驱者的老兵，你现在可以充当向导。帮助追随你的下一代教育先驱者。为他们指路――你仍然是先驱者。”

SILVERDALE, Wash. - Rear Adm. Stephen Barnett relieved Rear Adm. Scott Gray as commander, Navy Region Northwest in a change of command ceremony Friday, March 13.

The ceremony occurred at 10 a.m. on Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor, at the Navy Region Northwest headquarters building. Due to current COVID-19 concerns, Gray and Barnett hosted a virtual Change of Command ceremony, forgoing a more traditional Navy event.

“I’ve followed behind Scott Gray here and this will be the third time,” Barnett said gesturing towards Gray. “And every time I’ve followed behind him it has been a great turnover and he’s handed over a great staff, product and effort.”

Barnett is a native of Columbia, Tennessee. He earned his commission at Aviation Officer Candidate School in 1991. He is familiar with the Pacific Northwest having previously served as a naval flight officer attached to Patrol Squadron (VP) 46, Naval Air Station (NAS) Whidbey Island, Wash. Prior to his selection as commander, Navy Region Northwest he served as deputy commander, Navy Installations Command.

""The assets and missions in this area are definitely humbling and impressive,"" said Barnett, who toured Puget Sound Navy installations the past two weeks in preparation for assuming command.

Gray was awarded the Legion of Merit gold star in lieu of a fifth award during the ceremony.

""We have some of the most critical national missions here and we have a collection of critical capabilities unique in the world,"" Gray said, reflecting on his time in command. ""Growler aircraft, ballistic missile submarines, aircraft carriers, the expertise at the shipyard and the amount of maintenance work they do to keep our fleet at the leading edge. We can't do what we need to do without these critical capabilities.""


Gray also reflected on the relationship the Navy continues to share with surrounding communities. ""There's just a phenomenal amount of underlying support for the military and the people who are doing our mission,"" Gray said.

Gray was selected for his next assignment as commander, Navy Region Europe, Africa, Central.

NRNW encompasses the eleven-state area of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Minnesota, and Iowa.

291,"Rear Adm. Kitchener Visits SWOS, Addresses Graduates","NEWPORT, R.I. C Fifty students in the Department Head Course at the Surface Warfare Officers School (SWOS), here graduated Sept. 19 during a ceremony held in the Adm. Michael G. Mullen Auditorium.

The ceremony’s guest speaker, Rear Adm. Roy Kitchener, commander, Naval Surface Force Atlantic, reminded the graduates that this is a great time to be a department head in the world’s premier surface force. 

""For the first time in a very long time, the United States is in a great power competition,"" said Kitchener. ""The surface warfare community is generating combat-ready ships and battle-minded crews. You as a department head have a critical role in making this happen.""

Kitchener also thanked the graduates' families and friends in the audience, and acknowledged how their support makes the difference when it comes to success.

“Family readiness directly contributes to operational readiness,” added Kitchener.  

Part of a training continuum second to none, the 26-week course is designed to prepare surface warfare officers (SWOs) for successful tours as department heads on all classes of ships in the fleet.

The instruction is divided into two parts: Tactical Action Officer (TAO) and Operations Readiness, Training and Engineering (ORTE). The TAO portion focuses on areas including air defense, expeditionary operations, surface warfare and undersea warfare, and ORTE explores the specifics of each student's prospective assignment.

Capt. Christopher Alexander, SWOS commanding officer, charged the officers to take their time at SWOS to the fleet.

""Your Department Head tour will arguably be your most challenging and rewarding assignment you have as a SWO,"" said Alexander. 

Distinguished graduates included Lt. Bryce Yost who received the Arleigh Burke Award, selected by his classmates as the individual possessing the strongest leadership, industry and perseverance and the City of Newport Award for demonstrating the highest qualities of professionalism and leadership.

Lt. J.R. Dinglassen received the Top Gunner Award for the highest grade point average in the TAO curriculum, and Lt. Ryan Kelly was selected for the Top Snipe Award, as the prospective engineering officer with the highest grade point average in the engineering curriculum.

Many of the graduates will arrive at their ships within the week to begin 18- or 36-month tours.

While on hand, Kitchener visited the school’s state-of-the-art trainers and simulators, which the graduates utilized during their preparation, and also addressed students in the Advanced Division Officer Course and the Surface Commander’s Course.  

Headquartered in Newport, Rhode Island, and overseeing nine learning sites worldwide, SWOS readies sea-bound Sailors to serve on surface combatants as officers, enlisted engineers, and enlisted navigation professionals to fulfill the Navy’s mission to maintain global maritime superiority.

SURFLANT mans, trains and equips assigned surface forces and shore activities, ensuring a capable force for conducting prompt and sustained operations in support of United States national interests. More than 70 ships and 34 shore commands make up the SURFLANT Force.

292,Rear Adm. Roy Kelley Visits with Stennis Crew,"Rear Adm. Roy Kelley, commander, Naval Air Force Atlantic, visited the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis’ (CVN 74) senior leadership, June 12. 

During his first visit to the ship, Kelley was able to speak to senior leadership about the recent deployment the John C. Stennis Strike Group completed. 

“Your [John C. Stennis] deployment was a huge success, and DFE [dynamic force employment] played a large part in that success,” said Kelley. “DFE means unpredictability and with it comes challenges which you overcame with a high level of professionalism and dedication to the mission.”

The John C. Stennis Carrier Strike Group completed a seven-month around-the-world deployment through the 3rd, 7th, 5th, 6th, and 2nd Fleets, conducted multi-aircraft carrier operations with the Carl Vinson, Ronald Reagan, and Abraham Lincoln Strike Groups, the French aircraft carrier FS Charles De Gaulle (R 91), the Essex Amphibious Ready Group, and various ally navy units to include Australia, Great Britain, France, Korea and Japan. 

Kelley went on to discuss training and the future maintenance availability.

“As you prepare for refueling and complex overhaul (RCOH), the John C. Stennis is tasked with keeping our fleet aviators qualified. I need you to get underway on time, get out there, get the mission done, and get home,” said Kelley.

Commander, Naval Air Forces Atlantic’s Force Master Chief Huben Phillips mentioned that the John C. Stennis is full of experienced Sailors.

“To echo what the admiral said, smart and squared away Sailors are a good sign of a good ship C and that’s exactly what we see in the John C. Stennis,” said Phillips. 

The John C. Stennis left its homeport, Bremerton, Washington, October 2018 and is now pierside in its new homeport, Norfolk, Virginia. During their seven-month deployment they traversed 75,486 nautical miles, encompassed 9,331 launches and recoveries of aircraft and made five stops in foreign ports along the way.

294,Engineering Greatness- Rear Adm. Erroll M. Brown,"Engineered for Greatness: Erroll M. Brown

By Petty Officer Joshua Canup


An engineer is someone who takes many different parts and puts them together in working order, recognizing the worth and placement of each piece. Retired Rear Adm. Erroll M. Brown is one such engineer who rose through the ranks of the U.S. Coast Guard.

Growing up on his grandfather's farm in rural 1950s Florida, Erroll M. Brown and his older siblings always needed to finish their chores before they were allowed to play, a staple rule for many Southern homes in that time. Hard work early on reaped rewards for the rest of the day in the form of playing with friends and playing basketball.

Brown also found as a child he loved putting things together with his hands and figuring out how pieces fit together. In time, he'd learn that such work ethic and fascination would pay off in ways he'd never expect. Attending high school in St. Petersburg, Florida, he learned that his passion took focus in engineering. He especially loved drafting class where he would design homes and seeing them take shape. Everything had a place and fit where he wanted.

Around him, however, people were being told where they fit in society through Jim Crow laws.

""When you went out, you knew where you weren't supposed to go,"" said Brown regarding his childhood. ""Downtown, there were fountains marked for colored people and white people.""

While St. Petersburg was far removed from the infamous locales of the Civil Rights movement, it was not unaffected by the laws that enforced segregation. In high school, despite having top grades and even rising as a football star, Brown still faced discrimination for being African-American.

His determination, however, led to an unexpected delivery. Coming home shortly after graduation, Brown was informed he'd received a postcard: a simple three-cent postcard from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy that asked if he was interested in attending. On it were two boxes to check, yes or no.

Brown had no idea what the Coast Guard or its academy was about, but knew the importance of an education. His mother, a third grade teacher, had a master's degree and always encouraged him to pursue a higher education. She also made sure Brown was self-reliant and worked hard on his own rather than depending on others to help him.

""I once asked her for help on a math assignment in the fourth grade,"" said Brown, smiling. ""She told me 'I can't help you with that, son. I teach third grade math and you're in the fourth grade.' I was in the Academy lying in bed when it finally hit me. She had a master's degree, of course she could have helped me!""

While he laughs about it now, Brown knew the value of his mother's stern choice not to help him.

""She knew I needed to be able to do this on my own,"" said Brown.

By the time he was 17, Brown was focused on his education. This was his primary concern when he visited the Coast Guard Academy in 1968. Having not researched the Coast Guard or the Academy, Brown had no idea what he was in for.

""I told my folks to wait outside for me while I checked it out. Next thing I know, people are yelling at me, cutting my hair and I'm telling them I want to talk to my parents,"" said Brown. ""They informed me they were already gone!""

During the first part of his Academy life Brown was unsure he'd made a good choice. However, that changed as soon as life became more academic. The spark that had been Brown's passion for engineering flourished while in the Academy. After graduation Brown was stationed aboard several cutters, including the ice breaker Burton Island and 378-foot cutters Jarvis and Rush, and knew he'd found his career.

Brown's love of engineering stayed strong and he held several engineering positions as he rose up the ranks. During his time underway he enjoyed working alongside the talented enlisted personnel aboard.

""I had the engineering studies from the academy but the chiefs had the practical application,"" said Brown on his experience with Coast Guard chiefs, the senior enlisted personnel. ""They're the glue that holds the Coast Guard together and, while working hand-in-hand with them, I learned so much.""

His experiences and accomplishments led to his appointment as command of Coast Guard Base Portsmouth, Virginia. During his time as commander of the base he received some unexpected news. His wife, Monica, told him that he had a phone call from the commandant of the Coast Guard.

""I felt sick to my stomach,"" said Brown. ""He was calling from the command center and I just knew that something was wrong. You don't get a call like that unless something is wrong.""

To his surprise, the commandant hadn't called to tell him anything was wrong but that he had been selected to become an admiral, the first African-American admiral in the Coast Guard.

As an admiral, Brown's engineering culminated when he became commander of the Coast Guard's 13th District. He also served as the commander of Maintenance and Logistics Command Atlantic, or MLCLANT, in Norfolk, Virginia. MLCLANT provides maintenance and logistics support to Coast Guard commands in 40 states east of the Rocky Mountains, as well as commands in Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands and Europe.

After retiring in 2005 after 33 years of Coast Guard life, Brown looks back fondly at his Coast Guard career as having made his dreams come true. It's a long journey from a young boy in rural Florida to retired rear admiral but Brown believes his mother's encouragement and the life-saving culture of the Coast Guard pushed him along that journey.

""I love it,"" said Brown of the Coast Guard. ""The humanitarian culture, that's what's real.""",2017/2/17,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/224011/engineering-greatness-rear-adm-erroll-m-brown,"VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],弗吉尼亚州，美国,工程部-埃罗尔・M・布朗后方海军上将,为伟大而设计：埃罗尔・M・布朗比士官约书亚・卡努潘（Joshua CanupAn）是一名工程师，他将许多不同的零件按工作顺序组装在一起，认识到每件零件的价值和位置。退休的海军少将埃罗尔・布朗（Erroll M.Brown）就是这样一位工程师，他在美国海岸警卫队（U.S.Coast Guard）中晋升。埃罗尔・布朗（Erroll M.Brown）和他的兄妹们在20世纪50年代佛罗里达州农村的祖父农场长大，他们总是需要在获准玩耍之前完成家务活，这是当时许多南方家庭的一条主要规则。早期的努力工作为一天剩下的时间带来了回报，比如和朋友们一起玩和打篮球。布朗还发现，他还是个孩子的时候，就喜欢用手把东西拼在一起，弄清楚这些东西是如何组合在一起的。随着时间的推移，他会认识到这种职业道德和魅力会以他从未预料到的方式得到回报。在佛罗里达州圣彼得堡上高中时，他了解到自己的激情集中在工程学上。他特别喜欢在制图课上设计房屋，并看着它们成形。一切都有他想要的地方和适合的地方。然而，在他周围，人们通过吉姆・克劳的法律被告知他们适合社会的地方。“当你出去的时候，你知道你不应该去哪里，”布朗谈到他的童年时说。虽然圣彼得堡远离民权运动声名狼藉的地方，但它并非不受强制实行种族隔离的法律的影响。高中时，尽管布朗的成绩很好，甚至成为了一名足球明星，但他仍然面临着作为非裔美国人的歧视。然而，他的决心却导致了意外的结果。毕业后不久回到家，布朗被告知他收到了一张明信片：一张来自美国海岸警卫队学院的三美分明信片，问他是否有兴趣参加。上面有两个复选框，是或否。布朗不知道海岸警卫队或它的学院是关于什么的，但知道教育的重要性。他的母亲是一名三年级教师，拥有硕士学位，一直鼓励他接受高等教育。她还确保布朗能够自力更生，自己努力学习，而不是依靠别人帮助他。“我曾在四年级的数学作业上向她寻求帮助，”布朗笑着说。“她告诉我‘我帮不了你，孩子。我教三年级的数学，你上四年级了。’我在学校里躺在床上时，事情终于发生了。她有硕士学位，当然她可以帮我！’当布朗现在笑的时候，他知道他母亲不帮助他这一严厉选择的价值。布朗说：“她知道我需要自己来做这件事。”在他17岁的时候，布朗专注于自己的教育。这是他1968年访问海岸警卫队学院时最关心的问题。布朗没有研究海岸警卫队或学院，他不知道自己在干什么。”我告诉我的家人在外面等我检查。接下来我知道的事情是，人们对我大喊大叫，剪我的头发，我告诉他们我想和我的父母谈谈，”布朗说，“他们告诉我他们已经走了！“在他学院生活的第一阶段，布朗不确定自己是否做出了一个好的选择。然而，随着生活变得更加学术化，这种情况就改变了。布朗对工程的热情在学院期间迸发出火花。毕业后，布朗被派往数艘切割器上，包括破冰船伯顿岛和378英尺cJarvis和Rush知道他已经找到了自己的职业。布朗对工程的热爱一直很强烈，他在晋升过程中担任过几个工程职位。在任职期间，他喜欢与船上有才华的应征人员一起工作。“我从学院学过工程，但酋长们有实际应用，布朗在谈到他与海岸警卫队首领（高级士兵）的经历时说，“他们是把海岸警卫队团结在一起的粘合剂，在与他们携手合作的过程中，我学到了很多东西。”。他的经验和成就使他被任命为弗吉尼亚州朴茨茅斯海岸警卫队基地司令。在担任基地指挥官期间，他收到了一些意想不到的消息。他的妻子莫妮卡告诉他，他接到了海岸警卫队司令的电话。“我感觉胃不舒服，”布朗说。“他是从指挥中心打来的电话，我就知道有什么不对劲。除非有什么不对劲，否则你不会接到这样的电话。”令他惊讶的是，指挥官没有打电话告诉他有什么不对劲，而是说他被选为海军上将，海岸警卫队第一位非洲裔美国海军上将。作为一名海军上将，当布朗成为海岸警卫队第13区指挥官时，他的工程生涯达到了顶峰。他还担任维吉尼亚州诺福克的大西洋维修和后勤司令部（MLCLANT）指挥官。MLCLANT为落基山脉以东40个州的海岸警卫队司令部以及波多黎各、美属维尔京群岛和欧洲的司令部提供维护和后勤支持。在海岸警卫队33年的生涯后，布朗于2005年退休，他深情地回顾了自己的海岸警卫队生涯，认为这是他梦想成真的一年。从佛罗里达农村的一个小男孩到退休的海军少将，这是一段漫长的旅程，但布朗相信他母亲的鼓励和海岸警卫队的救生文化推动了他的旅程。“我喜欢它，”海岸警卫队的布朗说。“人道主义文化是真实的。”
295,Rear Adm. Young Visits NOSC North Island,"During a status of the force brief, Young highlighted some encouraging changes during his tenure as commander.  

“We just recently completed a manpower review,” said Young. “We looked at 123 NOSCs and rebalanced. Every NOSC now has a minimum of ten staff members. Every NOSC is going to have an Information System Technician. Every NOSC over 150 people will have a Navy Career Counselor.”

Young also focused on customer service stating that while customer service at NOSCs continues to improve, reservists are also responsible for efficiency. “I want every NOSC to continue to improve customer service, but this goes both ways. When the NOSC asks you for paperwork, you need to get it to them.”

Additionally, Young announced that the Defense Travel System (DTS) is piloting acceptance of back-to-back orders. This change is scheduled to be online by September 2016.

Young thanked reservists. “I could not do what you do. I could not be a drilling reservist. Less than one percent in this country serve, and even less than that are reserve. Balancing what you are doing with drilling, your civilian job, and your family…I could not do that. I want to thank you for what you do.”

Young also visited the Coastal Riverine Squadron One and the Undersea Rescue Command.  “I know the Undersea Rescue Command mission is very important. I know they have a high percentage of reservists. I want them to know how important what they do is, and that we at the senior leadership level see the fruits of their labor. It is an important mission, and it is zero fail.”",2016/8/6,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/206355/rear-adm-young-visits-nosc-north-island,"SAN DIEGO, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州圣地亚哥,杨少将访问北岛NOSC,在部队状况简报中，杨强调了他担任指挥官期间的一些令人鼓舞的变化。“我们最近刚刚完成了一项人力资源审查，”杨说。“我们调查了123家NOSC，并进行了重新平衡。每个NOSC现在至少有10名员工。每个NOSC将有一名信息系统技术员。每个超过150人的NOSC将有一名海军职业顾问。”杨还专注于客户服务，他说，尽管NOSC的客户服务不断改进，预备役军人也对效率负责。“我希望每个NOSC继续改进客户服务，但这是双向的。当NOSC要求你提供文书工作时，你需要把它交给他们。”此外，杨宣布国防旅行系统（DTS）正在试行接受背靠背订单。这一变化计划于2016年9月上线。年轻人感谢预备役军人。“我不能做你所做的。我不能成为一名钻井预备役军人。在这个国家，只有不到百分之一的人在服役，甚至不到百分之一的人是预备役军人。平衡你所做的钻井、你的文职工作和你的家庭……我不能那样做。我要感谢你所做的。”杨还参观了海岸河岸第一中队和海底救援司令部。“我知道海底救援指挥部的任务非常重要。我知道他们有很高比例的预备役人员。我想让他们知道他们所做的事情有多重要，让我们高层领导看到他们的劳动成果。这是一项重要的任务，是零失败的。”

C Equipment Operator 1st Class Michal Shafer, of Naval Mobile Construction Battalion (NMCB) 133, received her commission as an officer in the United States Navy via the Limited Duty Officer (LDO) program by Rear Adm. Katherine Gregory, commander, Naval Facilities Engineering Command and chief of Civil Engineers at the Gulfport Armed Forces Retirement Home on Sept. 25.

LDOs are technically-oriented officers who perform duties of specific occupational fields and have demonstrated strong managerial skills. As technical managers of the line or staff corps, LDOs progressively advance within broad technical fields related to their former enlisted ratings. They fill leadership and management positions at the ensign through captain levels that require technical background and skills not attainable through normal development within other officer designators.

Prior to the administering the oath, Gregory addressed Shafer, her family, and her friends. 

“I would just tell you that it is a privilege to wear this uniform and a privilege to serve our nation, and that privilege comes with responsibility, and the responsibilities that we expect of you are going to quadruple and be much greater,” said Gregory. “I’m excited for your future and I’m excited about your responsibilities that I know you will execute well.”

Following the oath, the floor was given to Ensign Shafer, where she recounted her career’s journey to this point. 

Shafer went on to thank her family, who have stood by her every step of the way and were there for another milestone in Shafer's career. 

“I started when I was 28 and before that, I was just going in circles in my life; not knowing what I wanted to do day-to-day,” said Shafer. “The military just seemed like an awesome choice. It’s been a long road; and it’s going be an even longer road ahead. However, I am super excited to see where the Navy takes me in the future.”

Shafer also thanked her mentor and friend, Lt. Cmdr. Mike Mosi, who was vital in her Navy career. 

“I knew this guy before I joined. He was a newly appointed ensign and he’s been with me since I started this adventure. I can’t believe I’m here ... I can’t believe you’re here,” joked Shafer. 

Upon receiving her commission, Shafer received her first salute from Master Chief Damage Controlman Vince Barry and passed her first class collar insignia on to NMCB 133’s Construction Mechanic 2nd Class Rachel Albers, who she believes will be a great first class petty officer.

297,"Adm. Samuel Gravely, Jr., Day to be Annually Commemorated in Virginia","As announced Tuesday before a passionate crowd, June 2 is now officially Adm. Samuel Gravely, Jr. Day in Virginia.  

June 2, 2021 recognizes the 50th anniversary of the promotion of Richmond-native Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. to the rank of admiral in the U.S. Navy, becoming the service’s first African American flag officer.  In a proclamation read aloud to three generations of Gravely family members, local citizens, and a Navy contingent from USS Gravely (DDG 107), the announcement, penned by Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, honored the boundary-breaking Richmond native. The Virginia War Memorial hosted the ceremony as coordinated by members of the Richmond Council of the Navy League.

“I am pleased to honor Adm. Samuel Gravely, Jr. for his many ground-breaking accomplishments” read the governor’s proclamation. 

“It took courage and patriotism to sign up for service after Pearl Harbor. Adm. Gravely continued to display that courage with a string of firsts―from being the first African American commissioned from the Navy Reserve Officer Training Course, to becoming the first African American to command a U.S. Fleet.” 

Gravely’s began his career as a seaman apprentice at Naval Station Great Lakes, Ill, in 1942. He would go on to be the U.S. Navy’s first African American commander, captain, rear admiral, and vice admiral. He was also the first African American to command a warship (USS Theodore E. Chandler (DD 717)); command a major warship (USS Jouett (DLG 29); achieve flag rank; and to command a numbered fleet (U.S. 3rd). 

He retired from the Navy in 1980 and died at age 82 in 2004. He led a distinguished career as a surface warfare officer and received many high-level awards to include the Legion of Merit, Bronze Star, Meritorious Service Medal, and the Navy Commendation Medal.

The Navy honored Gravely in 2010 with the commissioning of a destroyer named for the trailblazer, USS Gravely (DDG 107). A few members of the USS Gravely attended the ceremony and received the proclamation to post aboard the ship.

“Vice Admiral Gravely was truly a first for many accomplishments within the Navy, and his saying, ‘Education, Motivation, Perseverance’ runs true within the ship every day,” said the ship’s commanding officer, Cmdr. Corey Odom. 

“He wanted to be best at whatever he was: enlisted Sailor, executive officer, commander.  Gravely’s story shows that if we do what we do as best as we can, we can go anywhere in the Navy.”",2021/6/2,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/398200/adm-samuel-gravely-jr-day-annually-commemorated-virginia,"VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],弗吉尼亚州，美国,小塞缪尔・格雷夫利上将纪念日，每年在弗吉尼亚州举行,正如周二在热情的人群面前宣布的那样，6月2日是弗吉尼亚州正式的小塞缪尔・格雷弗里上将日。2021年6月2日是里士满本地人小塞缪尔・格雷弗里晋升美国海军上将军衔50周年纪念日，他成为美国海军陆战队首位非洲裔国旗官。弗吉尼亚州州长拉尔夫・诺瑟姆（Ralph Northam）为三代严肃的家庭成员、当地公民和严肃号航空母舰（DDG 107）的一支海军分遣队宣读了一份公告，纪念这位打破边界的里士满本地人。弗吉尼亚战争纪念馆主持了由海军联盟里士满委员会成员协调的仪式。总督公告中写道：“我很高兴向小塞缪尔・格雷夫利上将致敬，他取得了许多突破性的成就。”。“珍珠港事件发生后，签约服役需要勇气和爱国主义精神。从成为海军预备役军官培训班的第一位非洲裔美国人，到成为第一位指挥美国舰队的非洲裔美国人，阿梅里海军上将以一系列第一的成绩继续展示这种勇气。”1942年，格雷弗里在伊利诺伊州五大湖海军基地开始了他的海员学徒生涯。他将继续成为美国海军的首位非裔美国人指挥官、上尉、海军少将和海军中将。他也是第一位指挥战舰的非裔美国人（美国军舰西奥多・E・钱德勒号（DD 717））；指挥一艘大型战舰（美国军舰朱伊特号（DLG 29）；获得军旗军衔；指挥一支编号舰队（美国第三舰队）他于1980年从海军退役，于2004年去世，享年82岁。他以水面作战军官的身份获得了卓越的职业生涯，并获得了许多高级别奖项，包括荣誉军团、铜星、功勋勋章和海军表彰勋章。2010年，海军以tr命名的驱逐舰投入使用，获得了重大荣誉格雷维号航空母舰艾尔布雷泽号（DDG 107）。几名格雷维号航空母舰成员出席了仪式，并收到了登船公告。“格雷维号海军中将确实是海军许多成就的第一人，他的名言‘教育、激励、毅力’每天都在船上实现。”该舰指挥官科里・奥多姆中校说：“他想在任何方面都做得最好：应征水手、执行官、指挥官。格雷弗里的故事表明，如果我们尽我们所能做到最好，我们可以在海军的任何地方。”
298,Vice Adm. Jeffrey Trussler Visits IWTC San Diego,"By Information Warfare Training Command San Diego

SAN DIEGO C Vice Adm. Jeffrey Trussler, deputy chief of naval operations for Information Warfare and director of Naval Intelligence, visited Information Warfare Training Command (IWTC) San Diego as part of a fleet-wide tour of information warfare (IW) commands, May 17.

During his visit, Trussler met with IWTC San Diego leadership, staff, and students to deepen his understanding of the intelligence, cryptology, and information technology courses taught at the fleet-focused schoolhouse and to discuss future growth and alignment of IW training more broadly. 

After a command brief, Trussler was able to visit several courses in session that included the International Maritime Intelligence Course, Ship’s Signal Exploitation Equipment Increment Foxtrot (SSEE Inc F) Operator Course, Information Warfare Team Trainer (IWTT), and the Operational Intelligence Analyst Course.

IWTC San Diego instructors provided an overview of their respective courses and described their ability to update curriculum to keep pace with technological advances in the fleet. 

Lt. Elizabeth Powers, lead instructor for the IWTT, briefed Trussler on the transition towards Great Power Competition and the value of getting the intelligence teams into the schoolhouse’s premier intelligence team trainer as early as possible.  

“Because we do individualized training in the team environment, it’s always better to have the afloat intelligence teams come earlier in the pre-deployment training cycle,” stated Powers. “We can really help strengthen their knowledge of the western pacific and middle-eastern areas of responsibility.”

“It’s not every day that you get an opportunity to interact with your senior leadership,” remarked Cryptologic Technician (Collection) 2nd Class Christian Close, a lead instructor for the SSEE Inc F Operator Course. “Visiting with our community leader was exciting, not only for me but for the students as well.”

Trussler was also able to meet with several students from Navy Reserve, commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet Information Warfare Enterprise Team (CPF IW).

""Admiral Trussler's visit with our team consisting of Sailors from Camp Murray, Camp Parks, Denver, Fort Worth, and San Diego was a great opportunity for them to interact directly with a leader that has a direct influence on their future as IW professionals,” commented Lt. Cmdr. Jody Wang, executive officer of CPF IW San Diego. “He gave our Reserve Sailors insight and motivation, emphasizing the importance of reservists in the fleet.""

Cmdr. Tim Raymie, commanding officer IWTC San Diego, observed that Trussler’s visit was a superb opportunity for the command.  
“Vice Adm. Trussler was eager to engage us on the topics most important to us today,” said Raymie. “His engagement on subjects such as the transition from traditional to virtual training environments, curriculum improvement, and the effects upon the training mission from the Training Delivery Optimization initiative and pandemic-driven distributed workforce/telework were timely and well received by the staff.”

At the end of his visit, he thanked Raymie and his staff. “I appreciate all the hard work,” said Trussler. “The visit was very eye-opening.”

IWTC San Diego, as part of the Center for Information Warfare Training (CIWT), provides a continuum of training to Navy and joint service personnel that prepares them to conduct information warfare across the full spectrum of military operations.

With four schoolhouse commands, a detachment, and training sites throughout the United States and Japan, CIWT trains approximately 26,000 students every year, delivering trained information warfare professionals to the Navy and joint services. CIWT also offers more than 200 courses for cryptologic technicians, intelligence specialists, information systems technicians, electronics technicians, and officers in the information warfare community.

299,Vice Adm. Kitchener Speaks on Readiness at SNA Waterfront Symposium,"Vice Adm. Kitchener Speaks on Readiness at SNA Waterfront Symposium

From Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs

NAVAL BASE SAN DIEGO (Aug. 27, 2020) - Vice Adm. Roy Kitchener, Commander, Naval Surface Forces, delivered the keynote address at the Surface Navy Association’s (SNA) Waterfront Symposium, Aug. 27. 

Although the Navy cancelled its traditional public symposium due to COVID-19 restrictions, the event was held online and rebranded to a virtual event. This allowed the surface force to continue forward with the event and to open up the opportunity for attendance to a larger audience.

The theme of the professional development event was “Battle-Ready Ships for Today’s Fight.”

“You need to make it top priority to fix your equipment and train for battle, because the battle will not wait for you to be ready,” said Kitchener. “Uncertainty during this time of great power competition means that we’ll need to be ready. Despite challenges we’ve been tackling on a day-to-day basis, we must keep our eye on the ball. We in the Surface Forces are in the business of being prepared to fight and win at sea.”

Kitchener had a message for commanding officers during his address. 

“For our commanding officers, I want you to use that and push your authorities to take advantage of mission command C to have the freedom to act in getting the mission done,” Kitchener said. “But, an important part of that is understanding the risk. We need to assess the risks, properly communicate them to our leaders and crews, and then execute.”

Kitchener told the story of the quintessential surface warfare officer, Vice Adm. John Bulkeley, whose actions earned him a Medal of Honor. His attributes underpin the surface force’s values. 

Kitchener said the traits Bulkeley displayed are in the Surface Warfare community’s DNA, and the Surface Force will continue to strive toward the warrior traits reflected by Bulkeley and toward a culture of excellence.

“For four months and eight days, then Lt. Cmdr. Bulkeley savaged enemy forces without repairs, overhaul, or maintenance facilities for his ships,” Kitchener said. “He was a forceful and daring leader, willing to take calculated risks, executing offensive actions that demonstrated a resourcefulness and ingenuity which, I believe, makes him an outstanding leader and the epitome of a Surface Warrior.”",2020/8/27,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/377058/vice-adm-kitchener-speaks-readiness-sna-waterfront-symposium,"SAN DIEGO, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国加利福尼亚州圣地亚哥,Kitchener副上将在SNA海滨研讨会上发言,Kitchener副上将在SNA海滨研讨会上发言美国太平洋舰队公共事务海军圣地亚哥基地海军水面部队指挥官（2020年8月27日）-海军水面部队指挥官Roy Kitchener副上将在8月27日的水面海军协会（SNA）海滨研讨会上发表了主旨演讲。尽管海军由于新冠病毒-19的限制取消了其传统的公开研讨会，但该活动是在线举行的，并更名为虚拟活动。这使得水面部队能够继续推进这项活动，并为更多观众提供了参与机会。专业发展活动的主题是“为今天的战斗做好战斗准备的战舰”Kitchener说：“你需要把装备和战斗训练放在首位，因为战斗不会等待你做好准备。”。“在这个大国竞争的时代，不确定性意味着我们需要做好准备。尽管我们每天都在应对挑战，但我们必须时刻关注球。我们地面部队的任务是准备在海上作战并取得胜利。”基奇纳在讲话中向指挥官们传达了一条信息：“对于我们的指挥官来说，我希望你们能够利用这一点，推动你们的当局利用任务指挥权――在完成任务时有行动的自由，”基奇纳说。“但是，其中一个重要部分是了解风险。我们需要评估风险，适当地与我们的领导和工作人员沟通，然后执行。”基奇纳讲述了典型的水面作战军官约翰・伯克利（John Bulkeley）副上将的故事，他的行为为他赢得了一枚荣誉勋章。他的品质支撑着水面部队的价值观。基奇纳说，伯克利所展现的特质存在于水面作战社区的DNA中，水面部队将继续为这位战士而奋斗基奇纳说：“在四个月零八天的时间里，当时的伯克利中校在没有维修、大修或维护设施的情况下对敌军进行了野蛮的攻击。”。“他是一位强有力、勇敢的领导人，愿意承担经过深思熟虑的风险，采取进攻性行动，显示出他的足智多谋和独创性。我相信，这使他成为一位杰出的领导人和水面勇士的缩影。”

302,Rear. Adm. Kitchener Speaks at Basic Division Officer Course,"Rear Adm. Roy I. Kitchener, commander of Naval Surface Force Atlantic (SURFLANT), spoke with personnel attending the Basic Division Officer Course (BDOC), Nov. 15.

Kitchener expressed the importance of BDOC and how the course sets junior officers up for success.

“It starts here at BDOC, in the classroom and in the trainers, honing foundational skills and building your career to a graduate level education in tactics and combat leadership,” said Kitchener. “We expect you to continue to build that readiness as a surface warfare officer through enforcement of rigorous standards, a thorough understanding of the equipment under your cognizance and an unrelenting passion to lead the Sailors who look to you for a winning culture.”

The current BDOC class has 120 students, each assigned to different platforms and represent the diversity of the surface warfare community. Lt. Cmdr. Walter Brinkley, the officer-in-charge of BDOC, expressed how Kitchener’s remarks support the BDOC mission.

“Rear Adm. Kitchener speaking directly to these junior surface warfare officers personally reinforces the importance of what they are learning,” said Brinkley. “His remarks instills in them to continually develop their expertise and to contribute to their ship’s mission.”

BDOC, a nine week course, is the first stop for newly commissioned ensigns before they report to their respective ships where they learn basic division officer (DIVO) fundamentals including basic seamanship, navigation, engineering, maritime warfare, and damage control.

SURFLANT mans, trains and equips assigned surface forces and shore activities, ensuring a capable force for conducting prompt and sustained operations in support of United States national interests. More than 75 ships and 30 shore commands make up the SURFLANT Force.

303,Adm. Hyman G. Rickover Namesakes Celebrate Class of 2019,"CHICAGO -- The Hyman G. Rickover Naval Academy held its 11th annual commencement ceremony on June 8 and this year's commencement speaker traveled from Groton, Connecticut, where he oversees the training of the crew and construction of the newest Virginia-class attack submarine that bears the name of the legendary Adm. Hyman G. Rickover.

Cmdr. Thomas J. Niebel, Commanding Officer, Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) Hyman G. Rickover (SSN 795), provided this year's commencement address in front of an audience of more than 800 well-wishers.

""It was a special honor to host Cmdr. Niebel as this year's speaker"", said Cmdr. Mike Tooker, Commandant of the Academy.  ""Connecting the two namesakes of Adm. Rickover provided the cadets and audience a unique perspective on why Adm. Rickover was so important to the modern Navy, and why it was important for his hometown to recognize his accomplishments by naming a high school after him.""

""Additionally, the fact that Adm. Rickover was himself an immigrant who grew up on the Westside of Chicago, definitely resonated with the population of cadets and their respective families here at the Academy,"" said Tooker.

Niebel's remarks focused on a brief biographical sketch of Adm. Rickover and went on to focus on Adm. Rickover's personal traits and how those traits have been transmitted to both the Sailors onboard the PCU Rickover and the cadets at Rickover Naval Academy.

""An interesting thing about being a namesake, be it a school or submarine"", said Niebel.  ""A namesake is supposed to embody and demonstrate the characteristics, values, and beliefs of the person for whom they are named.""

Niebel continued, ""Here at Rickover Naval Academy, and the same holds true with the men who will sail aboard the USS RICKOVER, it is expected that you personify the values and beliefs of Adm. Rickover.""

Highlighting the achievements of the Class of 2019, Niebel related their accomplishments to the breakthroughs Adm. Rickover achieved, except the cadets made breakthroughs in their everyday life. 

This year's graduating class consisted of 112 graduates.  Collectively, the graduating class garnered more than $10 million dollars in scholarships and all graduates were accepted into at least one college or university.

Class Valedictorian Muhammad Navaid, who transferred to Rickover as a sophomore from a high school in Pakistan, received special recognition.

""His family had moved him and his three younger brothers to the U.S. for a chance at a better education and life,” said Tooker. ""Cadet Navaid seemed timid and a bit out of his comfort zone, which was completely understandable.  We were worried that he might not be able to adapt to our culture quickly enough and it would impact his academics, but boy were we wrong.""

""He not only adapted to our coursework and rigor, he far surpassed the classes offered at the Academy,"" Tooker continued.

""Due to his advanced Math and Science aptitude and self-starter attitude, he sought opportunities to take courses at the local community college, where he completed Calculus II and III, and also took AP Physics 1, 2, and C exams"", said Tooker.

Muhammad will be attending Illinois Institute of Technology in the fall and aspires to one day work for NASA as an aerospace engineer.

Another cadet who demonstrated and exemplified the values of Adm. Rickover is Cadet Angel Rubi.

""Since his freshman year, after inquiring about college opportunities for undocumented students, he has been an active member of the Rickover Dreamers Club"", said Niebel.  ""During his junior year, he began advocating for other undocumented students to come out of the shadows and inquire about possibilities of going to college, including going all the way Washington, D.C. to meet with U.S. Senators and Congressional Representatives.""

For his work and advocacy, Rubi was awarded the inaugural ""Red Dog Smith"" scholarship, in honor of the late Navy Lt. Cmdr. Ronald C. Smith, and received the 1st place Friends of Rickover Empowerment Scholarship.  Continuing his studies this fall, Rubi will be attending Arrupe College of Loyola University, Chicago.

""Our school has been truly fortunate,"" said Michael J. Biela, superintendent of the Academy.  ""Since we opened our doors in 2005, we've consistently had Navy leaders, both active-duty and reserve, stream through our entryway ready to engage and connect with our cadets, faculty, and staff.""

Biela continued, ""Cmdr. Niebel's engagement was special because he is the commanding officer of our Navy namesake and his inspirational remarks perfectly linked the legacy of Adm. Rickover with the newest USS RICKOVER and our naval academy.  It's my expectation that both namesake organizations continue to find opportunities to engage with each other and create a mutually beneficial relationship for the benefit of their respective Sailors and cadets.""",2019/6/8,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/326714/adm-hyman-g-rickover-namesakes-celebrate-class-2019,"GROTON, CT, UNITED STATES",[],[],格罗顿，CT，美国,海军上将海曼・G・里考夫与2019年同龄人庆祝毕业典礼,芝加哥――海曼・G・里考夫海军学院于6月8日举行了第11届年度毕业典礼，今年的毕业典礼演讲者从康涅狄格州格罗顿出发，监督船员培训和最新弗吉尼亚级攻击潜艇的建造，该潜艇的名字是传奇的海曼・G・里考夫上将。预调试单位（PCU）指挥官托马斯・尼贝尔（Thomas J.Niebel）海曼・G・里科弗（SSN 795）在800多名祝福者面前发表了今年的毕业典礼演讲。学院院长迈克・图克（Mike Tooker）中校说：“能够主持尼贝尔中校担任今年的演讲者，我感到特别荣幸。”。“将里科弗上将的两个同名人物联系起来，为学员和观众提供了一个独特的视角，让他们了解为什么里科弗上将对现代海军如此重要，以及为什么他的家乡以他的名字命名一所高中来认可他的成就如此重要。”“此外，里科弗上将本人是一名移民，在芝加哥西区长大，这一事实肯定引起了学院学员和他们各自家庭的共鸣，Tooker说。Niebel的评论集中在Rickover上将的一个简短的个人简历上，接着重点讨论了Rickover上将的个人特征，以及这些特征是如何传递给PCU Rickover上的水手和Rickover海军学院的学员的。“作为一个同名人，无论是学校还是潜艇，都是一件有趣的事情。”，尼贝尔说。尼贝尔继续说：“一个同名者应该体现和展示他们被命名的人的特征、价值观和信仰。在里科弗海军学院，同样的道理也适用于将要乘坐里科弗号航母的人，你应该将里科弗上将的价值观和信仰人格化。”Niebel强调了2019届的成就，并将他们的成就与Rickover上将取得的突破联系起来，除了学员在日常生活中取得的突破。今年的毕业班由112名毕业生组成。毕业班总共获得了1000多万美元的奖学金，所有毕业生都被至少一所学院或大学录取。班上的告别演讲人穆罕默德・纳瓦德（Muhammad Navaid）从巴基斯坦一所高中二年级转学到里科弗（Rickover），获得了特别的认可。图克说：“他的家人把他和他的三个弟弟搬到了美国，以获得更好的教育和生活。”。“海军少校导航设备看起来很胆小，有点超出了他的舒适区，这是完全可以理解的。我们担心他可能无法足够快地适应我们的文化，这会影响他的学术，但我们错了。”“他不仅适应了我们的课程和严格要求，而且远远超过了学院提供的课程。”Tooker继续说道：“由于他的高等数学和科学天赋以及自我启动的态度，他寻求机会在当地社区学院学习课程，在那里他完成了微积分II和III，还参加了AP物理1、2和C考试。”，穆罕默德将于秋季进入伊利诺伊理工学院，并渴望有朝一日成为美国宇航局的一名航空工程师。另一名展示和示范里考夫海军上将价值观的学员是安吉尔・鲁比（Angel Rubi）。尼贝尔说：“从大一开始，在询问无证学生上大学的机会后，他一直是里考夫梦想家俱乐部的积极成员。大三时，他开始倡导其他无证学生走出阴影，询问上大学的可能性，包括千里迢迢前往华盛顿特区会见美国参议员和国会代表。”由于他的工作和倡导，鲁比被授予就职“红狗史密斯”“奖学金，以纪念已故海军中校罗纳德・C・史密斯，并获得Rickover授权奖学金第一名。今年秋天，鲁比将继续他的学业，他将就读于芝加哥洛约拉大学阿鲁佩学院。该学院院长迈克尔・J・贝拉说：“我们学校真的很幸运。”。“自2005年我们开业以来，我们一直有现役和预备役海军领导人从我们的入口穿过，随时准备与我们的学员、教员和工作人员接触和联系。”Biela继续说道，“尼贝尔中校的参与是特别的，因为他是与我们同名的海军的指挥官，他的鼓舞人心的言论将里科弗上将的遗产与最新的里科弗号军舰和我们的海军学院完美地联系在一起。我期望这两个同名组织继续寻找机会相互接触，为各自的海员和学员创造互利关系。”

McCollum, Chief of Navy Reserve and commander, Navy Reserve Force, announced Hospital Corpsman 1st Class Neil Cataline as the 2018 Navy Reserve Shore Sailor of the Year during a ceremony held at the Maryland House on Naval Station Norfolk, Jan. 9. 

Cataline, one of five finalists from across the full-time support (FTS) Reserve Force, is a native of Antioch, Calif., and currently assigned to Marine Reserve Forces in New Orleans, La. The finalists represent the top five FTS first class petty officers in a force of more than 10,000.

“Events like this are a great reason to leave the Pentagon and go to the field,” said McCollum. “I believe this is the fun stuff. You all have earned the recognition, but we get to acknowledge and formalize your accomplishments. Congratulations Petty Officer 1st Class Cataline!”

During the event he was presented a Lone Star Memorial statue.

“I want to thank everyone here,” Cataline said. “What a great experience, I know all of my fellow competitors have great things ahead of them.”

Cataline also mentioned what he learned from this level of competition and what he expects moving forward.

“I learned a lot from this process,” said Cataline. “I realized I need to dig in a little more because it’s just going to get more competitive and difficult to win at the next level. Being selected from this group of Sailors was tough.”

Each finalist appreciated the recognition, but also expressed a mutual goal to be great leaders and hard workers.

“My experience getting this far has been surreal,” said Yeoman 1st Class Cerise Stout, a native of San Antonio, assigned to Commander, Naval Air Force Reserve in San Diego. “I’ve always just been one of those people that just works hard, and my hard work and taking care of Sailors led me to being a finalist.”

The other finalists:
Yeoman 1st Class Kristofer Keating, Reserve Component Command Mid-Atlantic
Logistics Specialist 1st Class George Lozada, Commander, Navy Reserve Forces Command
Yeoman 1st Class Jennifer Pare, Reserve Component Command Southeast

McCollum expressed his excitement about the future, looking at the representation of Sailors standing in front of him.

“I see the thousands of Sailors who were in your competitive lane that have followed in behind you, as you’ve led them with a competitive spirit,” said McCollum. “Thank you for your focus and your dedication as we pursue lethality and getting the Navy that our nation needs in the face of great power competition.”

Cataline will go on to compete for the title of 2018 Vice Chief of Naval Operations (Naval Shore Activities) SOY.

Deputy Commander, Navy Recruiting Command, Rear Adm. Andrew Mueller was the ceremony’s keynote speaker.  “It is an honor and a privilege to be able to speak about one of the greatest naval leaders of our time, Admiral Frank Kelso,” said Mueller, who made the trip from Millington, Tenn. to be present for the occasion. 

Kelso was born in Fayetteville, July 11, 1933, and was accepted into the U.S. Naval Academy in 1952, following one year of school at the University of the South at Sewanee. After graduating in 1956, he served on the cargo ship USS Oglethorpe (AKA 100) for one year before attending submarine school in 1958.  

Over his 38-year career,?he served all over the world, on six submarines, commanded the U.S. Naval Nuclear Power School, and worked his way up to Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Command, before becoming the CNO. As CNO, he oversaw the slimming of U.S. Naval forces following the Cold War. At the same time the Navy was getting smaller, he pushed the introduction of new platforms and systems that improved capabilities, and he led the Navy during Operation Desert Storm.  

A driving force behind Kelso’s leadership was the belief that the future of the Navy depended on the character of each Sailor. This is why the Navy adopted its current core values ― honor, courage, and commitment ― under his leadership. He also directed the establishment of the Sailors’ Creed, which every Sailor commits to memory, still to this day. 

In keeping with his emphasis on ethics, Kelso was also a strong advocate for women, and under his leadership, women in the Navy saw a large increase in opportunity and the ways they could serve. He assigned women to warships for the first time, and he made the Navy the first service to put women into tactical aircraft.

“It took courage for Admiral Kelso to change Navy culture,” said Mueller, “And our Navy is better for it.”

Kelso retired in 1994, and he and his wife, Landess, moved back to Fayetteville in 2003 for the remainder of their lives. He passed away Sunday, June 23, 2013 leaving a legacy of accomplishments and relationships, which he had built with family and friends in Fayetteville. 
Kelso’s life inspired members of the Inaugural Hometown Heroes to partner with local mayors and the Fayetteville-Lincoln County Museum Association to hold the ceremony in his honor.  

“Long before a Sailor joins the Navy, their values, judgement, morals, work ethic, and character are shaped and influenced by their families, their friends, and their communities,” said Mueller. “Admiral Kelso received that nurturing and influence right here in Fayetteville. The foundation of his life was forged during his formative years here in this town.”

The newly formed group, Friends of Adm. Frank B. Kelso Committee, has led the push for this event, and their Chairman, Dwight Lowdermilk, who retired as a Lt. Cmdr. in the Navy Supply Corps, helped to establish July 11th Admiral Frank Kelso day in Fayetteville.  

“I had been thinking for a while about how we could honor Admiral Kelso for his contributions to the citizens of Fayetteville and Lincoln County as well as being the CNO,” said Lowdermilk. “In January I spoke with Jon Law, mayor of Fayetteville, and Bill Newman, Lincoln County mayor, along with several city alderman and county commissioners about honoring Admiral Kelso with an Admiral Frank Kelso Day. They all agreed.” 

He was not only from the area, but he was also deeply involved in the community. He was the chairman of the church council at the Fayetteville First United Methodist Church, would regularly be a guest speaker for Leadership Lincoln and he donated all of his Navy memorabilia to the Lincoln County Museum. 

“He left a lasting legacy both here in Fayetteville, and in the Navy, and he was one of those Navy leaders that all of us today who wear the uniform wish to aspire to,” said Mueller. “He was a true patriot, he loved his country, he loved his family, he loved his hometown, and he loved his Navy.” 

From now on, Kelso’s birthday, July 11, will be set aside to honor other hometown heroes. Through this and the lives he’s touched, Kelso’s legacy will live on in Fayetteville.

307,USSOCOM and NAVSCIATTS Honor Poland’s Rear Adm. Piotr Stocki,"TAMPA, Fla. (NNS) -- Gen. Raymond Thomas, commander, U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), presented Naval Small Craft Instruction and Technical Training School's (NAVSCIATTS) 2015 Distinguished Alumni Award to Poland’s Rear Adm. Piotr Stocki, commandant, Border Guard Maritime Branch, during a ceremony held May 20 at USSOCOM. 

The Distinguished Alumni program was established in 2013 in conjunction with the 50th anniversary of NAVSCIATTS. Specifically, this award recognizes the impacts and specific accomplishments of former NAVSCIATTS graduates who leverage the collaborative network of global partners to pursue and implement multinational and trans-regional solutions. This network enables partners to reach across regional lines and facilitate information sharing and has proven beneficial in countering extremism, piracy, and criminal activities.  

""This is really an honor for us here at SOCOM,"" said Thomas. ""Rear Adm. Stocki has served with distinction for over 28 years in various key positions with the Polish Navy and the Border Guard Maritime Branch. He embodies the NAVSCIATTS motto of ‘Stronger Together,” and I look forward an ongoing and ever-strengthening relationship between Poland, the United States, and USSOCOM.""

Stocki first came to NAVSCIATTS in July 2011 when he participated in the Strategic Level Small Craft Combating Terrorism Course (SLC). In 2012, he returned to NAVSCIATTS as a SLC guest lecturer and guest speaker to share his experiences and emphasize his successful use of NAVSCIATTS’ network of global partners.

The SLC course provides international officers a forum to discuss shared challenges, while helping facilitate the formation of networks and trans-regional synchronization between partners who operate in the same geographic area and face similar problems. This network that reaches across oceans and continents allows for efficient sharing of information between U.S. forces and facilitates efforts with other agencies and international partners. 

According to Stocki, the Polish Border Guard Maritime Branch takes measures to neutralize border protection issues through regional cooperative networks and NAVSCIATTS’ SLC was the perfect course to familiarize him with planning, organizing and conducting operations in support of these regional issues.

“I consider this course to be one of my greatest professional training experiences, and a perfect opportunity to establish a dialogue, share experiences and build strategic relationships with other partner nations,” said Stocki. “I greatly appreciate the numerous lessons and good practices learned while at NAVSCIATTS, and to receive such an award is such an honor and a privilege.”

In addition to recognizing the accomplishments of NAVSCIATTS graduates, the Distinguished Alumni Award also helps serve as a conduit to support the maintenance of strategic relationships within the network of global partners. NAVSCIATTS does not view relationships in terms of weeks, months, or years; nor attempt to build them only after a crisis has been identified. NAVSCIATTS views relationships in terms of decades and nourishes these strategic partnerships through courses of instruction across the tactical, operational, and strategic spectrums to provide viable partners to U.S. leaders to support trans-regional synchronization.  

""Rear Adm. Stocki has been and continues to be an ambassador at large for NAVSCIATTS,"" said Cmdr. Clay Pendergrass, commanding officer of NAVSCIATTS. “We are drawn together by the common goals of protecting our families, our nations, and our world. I can’t thank Rear Adm. Stocki enough for being a key partner nation advocate within the network of global partners.” 

NAVSCIATTS is U.S. Special Operations Commands’ International Center specializing in mobile and in-resident training across the tactical, operational and strategic spectrums strengthening partner nation capabilities and capacity. 

NAVSCIATTS currently offers 19 courses with an average of nearly 1,000 personnel graduating from in-resident and mobile training events annually. Since 1963, nearly 11,000 students from 108 partner nations have graduated from NAVSCIATTS. Courses are offered in English and Spanish or in other languages through the use of translators.

308,Rear Adm. Andrews speaks at Savannah State University commencement,"SAVANNAH, Ga. - Rear Adm. Annie B. Andrews, commander, Navy Recruiting Command, delivered the commencement address to approximately 400 graduates at Savannah State University May 9.

During her speech, Andrews identified the Navy’s core values and how they apply to Sailors and civilians.

“There are three simple but powerful characteristics that make up our core values,” said Andrews. “They are: honor, courage and commitment. These are the seeds of success in decision making. These are the seeds of success in the development of our future leaders in the Navy and these seeds are vital to business and the management of human lives.”

Being an alumna of Savannah State University, Andrews was able to connect with the graduates on a personal level.

“I am so pleased to return to my alma mater and share this moment,” said Andrews. “I certainly would not be the person I am today without the Savannah State University experience and education.”

During her time at the university, Andrews was a Midshipman with the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps. (NROTC). This year’s graduation ceremony included the commissioning of 17 naval officers, the largest commissioning in Savannah State University’s history.

After the graduation ceremony, Dr. Cheryl D. Dozier, president of Savannah State University, announced the university is establishing two, $1,500 scholarships in Andrews' name to be awarded to NROTC female students.
 
""We are so very proud of Admiral Andrews' career accomplishments,” said Dozier. “As we celebrate the university's 125th anniversary this year, it is most fitting to have Admiral Andrews share her seriously impressive story with our graduates.""

309,"Adm. Horacio Rivero Jr.- Surface Warrior, Unsung Latino Leader","Two months after the ""Miracle at Midway"" stopped the Japanese advance in the Pacific, the U.S. Navy was beginning the fight that would eventually lead back to Tokyo, a road that started in the South Pacific’s Solomon Islands landing Marines and soldiers on the Japanese held island of Guadalcanal. 

It was August of 1942 and Lt. Cmdr. Horacio Rivero, Jr. was in the thick of the fight as the assistant gunnery officer on board the light cruiser USS San Juan (CL-54). 

Having commissioned the ship only five months prior, Rivero had been training up his team that manned the ship's after batteries from the start. Now was their time to shine.  Rivero was no stranger to sea duty, having spent a majority of his 11 years of active duty on surface ships. 

""During this period Captain (then Lieutenant Commander) Rivero ably controlled the after batteries of the USS San Juan during the effective supporting fire in the landing of our Marines at Guadalcanal on August 7, 1942,"" reads his Bronze Star Medal with Combat “V” device citation. 

""On the following day, when attacked by a large number of enemy shore-based torpedo planes, the batteries under his control shot down several of the attacking aircraft and inflicted hits on many others, contributing to their subsequent loss.""

""While conducting a lone raid on the Gilbert Islands in October 1942, his batteries efficiently contributed to the sinking of two Japanese patrol vessels and the capture of sixteen prisoners,"" the citation detailed. 

""On October 26, 1942, in the Battle of Santa Cruz, he superbly controlled the after batteries with devastating effect downing many enemy carrier-based aircraft...""

Better understood, it must be noted that the medal was awarded not for a singular action of heroism, but instead for the consistency, dependability, and sustained superior performance in combat that Rivero had demonstrated from Aug. 7, 1942 through April 24, 1943.  He truly was a warfighting surface warrior. 

Taking over as the gunnery officer, his service on the cruiser San Juan continued until late 1944 and was on board the ship through most of the South and Central Pacific campaigns where the ship was part of a covering force under command of Admiral William F. Halsey. 

The San Juan saw action at Bougainville in the Solomons; the capture of the Gilbert Islands in November 1943; during the series of carrier raids on Rabaul late that year; and the attacks on Kwajalein in the Marshalls in February 1944.

In late 1944 he briefly returned to the United States to commission the cruiser USS Pittsburgh (CA-72), first as the gunnery officer and later as executive officer. 

On June 5, 1945, a typhoon struck the ships of the Third Fleet, damaging 33, but Pittsburg was hit hardest.  Rivero, now the ship's executive officer, is credited for the survival of the ship and crew. 

During the raging storm, the ship's bow was snapped off by the wind and heavy seas ""like the head of a matchstick.""  Imagine a ship limping back to port without a bow to break the sea waves.

Rivero is heralded for the ship’s survival and the direction he gave for preparations of the ship during the storm as well as the handling of damage control efforts once the bow was lost. For his quick and forward-thinking he was awarded with the Legion of Merit Medal.   

""...He was particularly outstanding in his intelligent and timely direction of the heads of Departments of the ship, and his immediate inspections of damaged and flooded portions of the ship under extremely hazardous conditions and at the risk of his own life,"" the citation read. 

His actions ""resulted in correct decisions being made, damage boundaries being correctly established and the efforts of the entire ship's personnel being correctly directed to the end that no lives were lost and it was possible to bring the ship safely to port.""

The ship would later see action during the Iwo Jima and Okinawa campaigns and the first carrier raids on Tokyo. 

These first two decades of his career were filled with conflict, during which he was able to demonstrate toughness and resiliency despite the challenges.  Facing obstacles head-on and overcoming them, was a routine scenario for him.

A native of Ponce, Puerto Rico, but raised in Manatí, Horacio Rivero, Jr. was born May 16, 1910, to Margarita De Lucca Vda De Rivero and Horacio Rivero. 

Upon graduation from Central High School in San Juan (now Santurce), Puerto Rico, he secured an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis.  His first time on a ship, and entering the United States, was on the voyage to Baltimore that delivered him to school on the Severn.

Four years later, he graduated with distinction, third among the 441 graduates of the Academy Class of 1931.

The role model example that Rivero provides for our Navy can be best summarized as one of the underdog, albeit a persistent one that demonstrates unmatched leadership with a knack for winning.  

After the war, Rivero received command in 1948 of the destroyer USS William C. Lawe (DD-763). Again given command in 1951, this time of the transport USS Noble (APA-218), he led his ship and delivered the Marines to the amphibious assault of Inchon, Korea.

In flag rank, he commanded Destroyer Flotilla ONE. Later, he was personally selected by President Kennedy to take command of Amphibious Force, Atlantic Fleet during the Cuban Missile Crisis and subsequently lauded for his command's readiness during this period of national crisis. 

Appointed the vice chief of naval operations in July 1964, he served as the Navy's number two admiral until February 1968, overseeing much of the operation of the Vietnam War, including the resurgence of the brown-water navy that he passionately advocated for.

When when he took the helm of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s Allied Forces, Southern Europe at the height of the Cold War, he was able to merge military power with our principles for deterrence and engagement amongst our allies.  

""...In the face of limited material resources, regional political upheavals, and the dramatically increased Soviet penetration of the Mediterranean, he persuasively rallied the common determination of Southern Region nations; developed plans to counter the Soviet threat; implemented the 'Flexible Response' strategy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and intensively exercised the allied armies, navies and air forces in a variety of complex national and multinational maneuvers and exercises..."" According to his Distinguished Service Medal Citation, given him upon his retirement in June of 1972. 

It was no wonder then why he wouldn’t continue to serve the nation even after retiring from the Navy in 1971.  Appointed by President Nixon, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to Spain from 1972 to 1974. 

Demonstrating the pride he maintained for his island, he became the Honorary Chairman of the American Veterans' Committee for Puerto Rico Self-Determination.

Along with his decorations from the United States, he was recipient of the Order of Abdon Calderon from the Republic of Ecuador and the Order of Merito Naval from the Republic of Brazil.

Rivero passed away on Sept. 24, 2000 and is buried in Ft. Rosecrans National Cemetery on Point Loma in San Diego.

Even the word legendary falls shorts of the exemplary manner in which Rivero's service is remembered.  Nearly 40-years in uniform and rising to four stars, Rivero serves as an example to all our career Surface Warriors, regardless of rank or background.

Without a ship to bear his name, it remains on each of us to reinforce his story and example for the generations of Sailors that follow; particularly those Latino leaders in uniform.

The next time you consider overlooking someone or one of their ideas because of an accent, perceived social class, or their junior rank, remind yourself of Rivero ― even the least expected, from the humblest of beginnings, with persistence, integrity, intellect and courage, can reach the summit of leadership within our organization.

Rivero may be an unsung hero, but his career proved he should be anything but.

310,Rear Adm. Tom Anderson Debuts Rough Riders Award at SERMC,"MAYPORT, Fla., ― Fourteen employees of the Southeast Regional Maintenance Center (SERMC) were honored as the first inductees into the new “Rough Riders Team” on Nov. 4 by Rear Adm. Tom Anderson, Commander, Navy Regional Maintenance Center (CNRMC) and Director, Surface Ship Maintenance and Modernization (SEA 21) of Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA)..

“The Rough Rider award recognizes our people who go above and beyond the call of duty. Ship repair is a tough business, there are long hours and most people don’t understand or realize the amount of behind the scenes work that goes into getting these ships underway. It’s the people who embody President Roosevelt’s Rough Riders ethos of prioritize, communicate and finish that earn a spot on the team,” Anderson said during his visit to SERMC.

Six SERMC employees earned the SEA 21/CNRMC Rough Rider awards for overseeing and completing emergent repairs expeditiously on USS Detroit (LCS 7), ensuring the littoral combat ship was on time for its maiden deployment, the first LCS Freedom-variant block-buy ship to deploy on the East Coast.

The USS The Sullivans (DDG 68) maintenance team became Rough Riders for completing the ship’s CNO availability early and mission-ready. The team’s effective communication, teamwork and ability to resolve problems all played vital roles during the five-month endeavor. In total, 110 depot and numerous intermediate level work items were completed, including a major Vertical Launch System cooling upgrade, Ballistic Missile Defense package installation, Consolidated Afloat Network and Enterprise Services communications upgrade and several major structural improvements. 

“The standards are being set by the SERMC team members acknowledged here today with regards to on-time delivery and timely correction of material deficiencies on ships. This is exactly how we need to operate going forward. You correctly planned, made sure everything lined up during execution, and attacked each work item to completion in order to return the ship to the Fleet on time,” Anderson concluded.

CNRMC is a Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) field activity and oversees the operations of Regional Maintenance Centers in their execution of surface ship maintenance and modernization. SEA 21 is the dedicated life cycle management organization for the Navy's in-service surface ships and is responsible for managing critical modernization, maintenance, training and inactivation programs.

311,Senate Confirms Rear Adm. Gillingham as next Navy Surgeon General,"The U.S. Senate confirmed Rear Adm. Bruce L. Gillingham as the U.S. Navy’s next surgeon general on October 31, 2019.

“I am honored and privileged to represent Navy Medicine as the 39th Surgeon General of the Navy,” said Gillingham. “We are now engaged in a great power competition where our dominance is not assured, we must adapt and respond with urgency. The duty of every member of the Navy Medicine team is to provide a ready medical force and operational medical capabilities to save lives in the battlespace.”

Gillingham is the 39th Surgeon General of the Navy and the 43rd person to hold the title of Chief of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. He is also the first orthopedic surgeon ever to serve as U.S. Navy Surgeon General.
The new Navy Surgeon General said he plans to use four priorities to guide Navy Medicine in the future fight. 

PEOPLE C Our military and civilian workforce is our greatest strength. 

PLATFORMS C Our equipment and capability sets required by our warfighters.  

PERFORMANCE C Our performance is measured by our support to our warfighters.  

POWER C Medical power projection will increase survivability.  

“Focusing on these four ‘Ps’ will drive us to mission success by increasing lethality through warfighter preparation and survivability.  To ensure continuity of care to our beneficiaries, Navy Medicine will continue to support the Defense Health Agency in transition, but our direction and focus must be on the 4 ‘Ps’,” said Gillingham.

Gillingham is a graduate of the F. Edward Hebert School of Medicine at the Uniformed Services of the Health Sciences.  He has served in various positions throughout his career to include director of Pediatric Orthopedic and Scoliosis Surgery; Associate Orthopedic Residency Program director; and director of Surgical Services.

312,Vice Adm. Forrest Faison Discusses the Future of Navy Medicine at AMSUS,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. (NNS) C On Thursday, Nov. 29, Vice Adm. Forrest Faison, Navy surgeon general and chief, U.S. Navy of Bureau of Medicine and Surgery came together with military medicine leaders during AMSUS for a panel discussion on the future of the services as they begin to transition medical facilities to the Defense Health Agency (DHA). 

On Oct. 1, 2018 Navy Medicine began phase one of the DHA transition, transferring Naval Hospital Jacksonville administration, management and control to the DHA. While this transition presents significant change for Navy Medicine, the mission to keep Sailors, Marines and their families healthy and ready does not.

“The Navy is taking advantage of the many opportunities that come with this transformation. It allows us to focus on our true north and ensure we’re doing all we can to save lives and return sons and daughters home to their families” said Faison. 

Several transition initiatives and milestones were shared by the services, yet the recurring theme throughout the panel’s discussion revolved around the importance of readiness.

Faison went on to describe the unique ways in which Navy Medicine is supporting the transition and taking steps to maintain readiness as hospitals and clinics transition administration, management and control to the DHA. For patients, these reforms should have little or no effect on their experience, facility and physicians. Coverage will remain the same, and patients will continue to receive the same exceptional level of care and service.

“We are focused on a future of design, not default,” said Faison. 
To complement changes in the organizational construct of the DHA, Navy Medicine will establish Readiness and Training Commands that support the Navy’s mission and the DHA’s role of administration and management of the MTFs.

 “The Navy Medicine Readiness and Training Commands (NMRTCs) will focus on platform readiness and training so that beneficiaries can continue to receive the same level of care,” said Faison.

While the transition itself presents a great amount of change, the evolving future of warfare and health care will also continue to drive changes in the way the Navy delivers care. The emergence of great power competition and the growing capabilities of near-peer competitors to project seapower could indicate the next war at sea. 

“If you’re going to fight tonight, you’ve got to be able to save lives tonight,” Faison said. “Every mom and dad in America is depending on us to do that.” 

As the transition continues and the warfighting environment evolves, Navy Medicine will adapt and provide the necessary functions and capabilities needed to fight the next fight, whether it be on sea, land or in the air. 

The AMSUS Annual Meeting runs from Nov. 27 through Nov. 30 and brings together top military and federal health leaders, industry experts, and medical professionals. Topics such as global health, Military Health System transformation, DoD’s new electronic health record MHS GENESIS, virtual health, and pain management have been points of discussion over the course of the week. Speakers also share their knowledge of the latest advances in military and federal health care, including innovative research and patient care.

Navy Medicine is a global health care network of 63,000 personnel that provides health care support to the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, their families and veterans in high operational tempo environments at expeditionary medical facilities, medical treatment facilities, hospitals, clinics, hospital ships and research units around the world.

313,Adm. Joel T. Boone Branch Health Clinic Change of Charge,"The Adm. Joel T. Boone Branch Health Clinic held a change of charge ceremony here, June 22.

Cmdr. Dawn Freeman relieved Cmdr. Kathleen Cooperman as the officer in charge (OIC) of the health care triad that includes Boone Branch Health Clinic, the Northwest Branch Health Clinic and TRICARE Prime Clinic Virginia Beach.

“Two exemplary officers will cross paths on this stage today. This rotation of staff is somewhat unique to us in the Navy. Bill Gates has always been Microsoft, Bill Forbes always been Forbes. Majority of our corporate leadership has essentially run from the beginning, but not here, we have two or three years,” said the presiding officer present at the ceremony, Capt. Christopher Culp, Naval Medical Center Portsmouth’s commanding officer.  “Additionally, commands benefit immensely from the frequent infusion of new ideas, philosophies, direction, and style. It prevents anything from sitting on the back burner.”

Cooperman assumed the duties as OIC in September 2015, and she will be staying in the area since her next duty station is Navy Medicine East, located within the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth campus in Portsmouth, Virginia.

“As Boone triad OIC, I have been afforded the opportunity to serve with so many phenomenal people who are the ones who make it happen,” said Cooperman. “My job was really to move the barriers and clear the way for this incredibly talented staff could ensure we maintained access to care for the 43,000 beneficiaries that are enrolled to the triad.”

Cooperman was presented the Meritorious Service Medal for her accomplishments while OIC of the Boone Branch Health Clinic triad.  Some of the accomplishments during her time as OIC included overseeing a triad that provided health care to beneficiaries every day of the year.  More than 750 medical and 150 dental visits were completed, and 1,400 prescriptions filled for active duty and dependent beneficiaries. The triad also supported hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico late last year.  Recognition included the Vickie Garner award for excellence in quality and the Navy Surgeon General's Blue H gold level award.

As Freeman accepted the OIC position, she said, “To the staff, I am truly humbled by the opportunity to be your OIC. It is an honor and a responsibility that I do not take lightly.”  

Freeman, a Green Bay, Wisconsin native, becomes the newest OIC after completing a successful tour at the Navy Warfare Development command.  Other tours of duty include director for administration at Naval Health Clinic Quantico, NMCP associate director for Health Care Business Operations, associate director for operations for the Director of Surgical Services, in addition to deployments in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

“Let us be reminded that the building that we occupy to administer healthcare to our beneficiaries was dedicated in 1972, after Admiral Joel T. Boone, a true American hero and patriot,” said Freeman.  “We will strive to maintain our clinic’s reputation as the number one branch clinic in Navy medicine. You have my word that I will do everything in my power to prepare us for the challenges that lie ahead. Let’s get to work.”

The Boone Branch Health Clinic triad is part of Naval Medical Center Portsmouth umbrella of care for beneficiaries throughout the Hampton Roads area.  NMCP is the U. S. Navy's oldest, continuously-operating hospital since 1830 and is a nationally acclaimed, state-of-the-art medical center, along with the area’s branch and TRICARE Prime clinics.

314,"Vice Adm. Brown Gets Underway on LCS; impressed with capabilities, Sailors","SAN DIEGO ― Vice Adm. Rich Brown, commander, Naval Surface Forces (SURFOR), embarked USS Coronado (LCS 4) March 16, as the ship got underway from Naval Base San Diego for the final stage of Coastal Mine Reconnaissance (CMR) mission module testing.

The underway period gave Brown his first opportunity to experience how littoral combat ships (LCS) operate at sea. He told the crew he was impressed with the capabilities of the ship and her Sailors.

“These ships bring unmatched capability to the Surface Navy and provide flexibility to our fleet commanders,” said Brown.  “You can't understand the incredible capacity of these ships until you've been underway on one.”  

During the visit, Brown took an extensive tour of the ship, engaging with Sailors and answering their questions along the way.

“Having Vice Adm. Brown on board gave us the chance to talk to one of the top commanders in the Navy,” said Culinary Specialist 1st Class Michael Mahan, from South Kortright, New York. “Even with his comprehensive knowledge about Navy ships, he specifically wanted to know about our ship, our work environment and our equipment ― all the pros and cons and the issues we may be facing.”

While addressing the crew over the ship’s intercom system, Brown commended the Sailors on their successes thus far, yet challenged each Sailor to remain focused during the final stage of the CMR module testing.  

“This is the best day I’ve had in my first two months as the Surface Force commander,” said Brown.  “Like all Surface Warfare Officers I love being at sea and being able to get underway, but that experience is all the more rewarding when you see the dedication and professionalism the captain and crew have displayed during this testing phase.”

“I am impressed with this fantastic crew.  This is one of the best crews I have been around in my 33 years,” Brown said after the embark.  

Last month, and ahead of schedule, the ship completed the first stage of module testing, known as developmental testing. During developmental testing the ship's crew and aviation detachment exercised the module in realistic environmental conditions, verifying that the system is now ready for operational testing.

“I think this visit provided Vice Adm. Brown the LCS experience he was hoping for,” said Cmdr. Karl McCarthy, the ship’s commanding officer and a native of North Easton, Massachusetts. “He saw first-hand the vital testing we are conducting, heard from our operators about the tremendous capabilities that LCSs offer the Fleet, and he told us he was impressed with and applauded the continued growth and recent successes of USS Coronado and the entire LCS program.”

“This was a morale booster for our crew and we were honored to have SURFOR onboard our ship for his first underway on an LCS,” said McCarthy.

Coronado is one of four testing ships assigned to Commander, Littoral Combat Ship Squadron ONE. Since returning from deployment in late 2017, the ship has been testing the CMR module, which consists of the MQ-8B Fire Scout unmanned aerial vehicle, the AN/DVS-1 Coastal Battlespace Reconnaissance and Analysis (COBRA) system, and supporting software and containers. 

Brown assumed command of SURFOR in January 2018 after having served as commander of Navy Personnel Command (NPC) and deputy chief of naval personnel. 

SURFOR mission is to man, train and equip ships that provide fleet commanders with combat naval power at sea and to project that power ashore.

316,Adm. Harris credits Hawaii’s role in Indo-Asia-Pacific rebalance,"HONOLULU C Adm. Harry Harris, U.S. Pacific Command commander, spoke to government officials, private sector representatives and military leaders about Hawaii’s importance in the future of the Indo-Asia-Pacific during the annual Military Affairs Council (MAC) Meeting and Partnership Conference at Washington Place here, Jan. 15.

During his remarks Harris recognized the MAC and state leaders for their support in communicating how joint military forces in Hawaii support the national security strategy and ongoing rebalance initiative. 

“Due to the outstanding communications conducted by Governor Ige, Mayor Caldwell, Senator Schatz and Hirono, Representatives Gabbard and Takai, and all of our local state officials, decision makers in Washington and throughout the region are well aware that Hawaii remains the “Gateway to America’s rebalance to the Indo-Asia-Pacific,” Harris said.

Hawaii serves as a gateway to the rebalance by utilizing its assets in operations throughout the region and the defense of the homeland. Harris said that there is no doubt that the United States economic future is firmly tied to the Indo-Asia-Pacific and that everyone at every level must work together to strengthen civil and military relationships with each other and with other nations in the region. 

Harris then explained the state’s role in supporting the rebalance, stating that Hawaii is the only place in the world where all component commanders are geographically co-located together, allowing forces to train and operate jointly and benefit from a face-to-face relationship, an advantage made largely possible because of the support from the state. 

“This gives us an extraordinary advantage and it wouldn’t be possible without the continued dedication and support from Hawaii’s community, civic and industry leadership,” Harris said. “In addition to our forces in Hawaii, the presence and capabilities we are bringing forward into this theater are commensurate with the challenges that we face.”

The support has influenced the strengthening of partnerships such as the Philippine Supreme Court’s decision that the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) is consistent with their constitution, strengthening security ties between the Philippines and the United States.

“The agreement will facilitate the enhanced rotational presence of the U.S. military in the region, and support the long-term modernization of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,” Harris said. “This will enable the United States and the Philippines to continue supporting the international rules-based order that has served the region so well.”

Despite successes within the Indo-Asia-Pacific, Harris emphasized that security and stability which the region has enjoyed can’t be taken for granted and that Hawaii’s role to the rebalance will continue to support PACOM’s commitment to the security and safety of the nation’s allies as possible threats in the region emerge.

“Security challenges such as North Korea threaten to destabilize the region and reverse the trends of transparency and prosperity that we’ve all enjoyed,” Harris said. “America is rebalancing to the Indo-Asia-Pacific to meet those challenges and reinforce the international rules-based order that has benefited the region for more than 70 years and Hawaii plays a critical role.”

At the end of his remarks, Harris thanked the MAC for their continued support.

“Thank you for everything you do in support of our men and women in uniform and helping to ensure that we remain ready to fight tonight and win,” Harris said. “May God bless our veterans, this great state and this beautiful city and may God bless our nation.”",2016/1/15,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/186435/adm-harris-credits-hawaiis-role-indo-asia-pacific-rebalance,"HONOLULU, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],檀香山，你好，美国,哈里斯上将赞扬夏威夷在印度-亚太再平衡中的作用,檀香山―美国太平洋司令部司令哈里・哈里斯上将在华盛顿广场举行的年度军事委员会（MAC）会议和伙伴关系会议上向政府官员、私营部门代表和军方领导人讲述了夏威夷在印度-亚太地区未来的重要性，1月15日。哈里斯在讲话中赞扬了陆委会和州领导人在传达夏威夷联合军事力量如何支持国家安全战略和正在进行的再平衡计划方面给予的支持。“由于州长伊格、市长考德威尔、参议员沙茨和广野、众议员加巴德和塔凯以及我们所有的地方州官员进行了出色的沟通，华盛顿和整个地区的决策者都清楚地意识到夏威夷仍然是“美国重新平衡印度-亚太地区的门户”哈里斯说。夏威夷通过在整个地区的军事行动和国土防御中利用其资产，成为实现再平衡的门户。哈里斯说，毫无疑问，美国的经济未来与印度-亚太地区紧密相连，各个层面的每个人都必须共同努力，加强民事和军事力量哈里斯随后解释了该州在支持重新平衡中的作用，指出夏威夷是世界上唯一一个所有部队指挥官在地理位置上都位于同一地点的地方，允许部队联合训练和作战，并从面对面的关系中受益“这给了我们一个非凡的优势，如果没有夏威夷社区、公民和行业领袖的持续奉献和支持，这是不可能的，”哈里斯说。“除了我们在夏威夷的部队外，我们在该战区的存在和能力与我们面临的挑战是相称的。”这种支持影响了伙伴关系的加强，例如菲律宾最高法院决定加强国防合作协议（EDCA）哈里斯说：“该协议将有助于加强美军在该地区的轮流驻扎，并支持菲律宾武装部队的长期现代化。”。“这将使美国和菲律宾能够继续支持基于规则的国际秩序，这一秩序在该地区发挥了巨大作用。”尽管在印度-亚太地区取得了成功，哈里斯强调，该地区所享有的安全与稳定不能被视为理所当然，夏威夷在重新平衡中的作用将继续支持太平洋司令部在该地区可能出现的威胁出现时对国家盟友的安全与保障的承诺。哈里斯说：“像朝鲜这样的安全挑战有可能破坏该地区的稳定，扭转我们大家都享有的透明和繁荣的趋势。”。“美国正在向印度-亚太地区重新平衡，以应对这些挑战，并加强基于规则的国际秩序，这一秩序已使该地区受益70多年，夏威夷发挥了关键作用。”哈里斯在讲话结束时感谢陆委会的持续支持。哈里斯说：“感谢你们为支持我们的男女军人所做的一切，感谢你们帮助我们确保我们今晚随时准备战斗并取得胜利。愿上帝保佑我们的退伍军人、这个伟大的州和这个美丽的城市，愿上帝保佑我们的国家。”
317,Adm. Swift talks regional trends during Cooperative Strategy Forum,"HONOLULU C U.S. Navy Adm. Scott Swift, commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet, spoke to more than 100 personnel at the Daniel K. Inouye Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS) during a cooperative strategy forum co-hosted by the Chief of Naval Operations Dec. 14.

During the forum Swift delivered a keynote speech to attendees that shared his expectations of those operating in the waters of the Indo-Asia-Pacific.

“I’m focused on the behavior of all naval and maritime forces in the region, not on any specific country,” Swift said. “I expect all naval and maritime forces, including my own, to operate responsibly, safely and in full compliance with international law.”

The event involved representatives from ten partner nations with a focus on participants gaining a better understanding of each other’s viewpoints and fostering improved future collaboration.

U.S. Navy Capt. Patrick Gibbons, chief of Naval Operations Staff operations, plans and strategy legal adviser and oceans policy adviser, explained how the forum builds relationships and strengthens collaborative efforts between the U.S. and its allies.

“This forum is designed to facilitate an exchange of views among all our allies and partners in the region,” Gibbons said. “This exchange of views helps us to understand each other’s approaches to the challenges in the region but it also facilitates personal relationships between the attendees. We have flag officers, O-6s, O-5s, and in the case of some countries O-4s who are going to be here and spend two days with their U.S. and other foreign country counterparts.”

U.S. Navy Cmdr. Jonathan Odom APCSS military professor and Cooperative Strategy Forum organizer, said that the APCSS also benefits from these types of multinational events.

“One of the top three priorities in our curriculum both in workshops and courses that we teach is now maritime security,” Odom said. “For us to hold an event here where you have the leaders or representatives of the leaders of the navies throughout this region discussing ways to cooperate on maritime issues is clearly quite an opportunity for us.”

As part of the event, Swift explained why maintaining cooperation between partner nations in the region is important.

“Today all Indo-Asia-Pacific nations benefit from a rising tide of prosperity,” Swift said. “We all have major stakes in this region’s continued success, especially at sea, where so much of our trade, investment and interaction take place.”

Swift then offered his thoughts on the way ahead for the Indo-Asia-Pacific region.

“I’m convinced the continued promotion of the rules-based system that evolved over the past 70 years remains the best way forward for all nations in this region, large and small, to continue to rise peacefully, confidently, securely, and economically,” Swift said. “My concern is that after many decades of peace and prosperity at sea, we may be seeing the leading edge of a return of ‘might makes right’ to the region. Such an approach may once again impact the vibrant but vulnerable waters of Southeast Asia.”",2015/12/14,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/184535/adm-swift-talks-regional-trends-during-cooperative-strategy-forum,"HONOLULU, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],檀香山，你好，美国,斯威夫特上将在合作战略论坛上讨论地区趋势,檀香山―美国太平洋舰队司令斯科特・斯威夫特海军上将在丹尼尔・K・伊诺伊亚太安全研究中心（APCSS）与100多名人员交谈12月14日，在海军作战司令共同主持的合作战略论坛上，斯威夫特向与会者发表了主旨演讲，表达了他对印度-亚太水域作战人员的期望。“我关注的是该地区所有海军和海上部队的行为，而不是任何特定国家。”斯威夫特说。“我希望所有海军和海上部队，包括我自己的部队，都能负责任地、安全地、完全按照国际法运作。”来自十个伙伴国家的代表参加了这次活动，重点是让与会者更好地了解彼此的观点，促进未来更好的合作。海军作战参谋长、作战、计划和战略法律顾问兼海洋政策顾问帕特里克・吉本斯海军上尉解释了该论坛如何在美国及其盟国之间建立关系并加强合作。吉本斯说：“这个论坛旨在促进我们在该地区的所有盟友和伙伴之间交换意见。”。“这种意见交流有助于我们了解彼此应对该地区挑战的方法，但也有助于促进与会者之间的人际关系。我们有国旗官、O-6、O-5以及一些国家的O-4，他们将在这里与美国和其他外国同行共度两天“美国海军指挥官乔纳森・奥多姆（Jonathan Odom）APCSS军事教授兼合作战略论坛组织者说，APCSS也从这些类型的多国活动中受益。“我们课程中最重要的三个优先事项之一，包括研讨会和我们教授的课程，现在是海上安全，”奥多姆说。“对于我们来说，在这里举办一次活动，让该地区各国海军领导人或代表讨论如何在海事问题上进行合作，这显然是一个很好的机会。”作为活动的一部分，斯威夫特解释了为什么保持该地区伙伴国家之间的合作非常重要。斯威夫特说：“今天，所有的印度-亚太国家都受益于日益高涨的繁荣浪潮。我们在该地区的持续成功中都有着重大的利害关系，特别是在海上，我们的贸易、投资和互动如此之多。”斯威夫特接着提出了他对印度-亚太地区未来道路的看法。斯威夫特说：“我相信，继续推进过去70年来形成的以规则为基础的体系，仍然是该地区所有国家，无论大小，继续和平、自信、安全和经济崛起的最佳途径。”。“我担心的是，在海上几十年的和平与繁荣之后，我们可能会看到‘强权使权利’回归该地区的前沿。这种做法可能会再次影响到充满活力但脆弱的东南亚海域。”

Milwaukee Valve Company is the Navy’s largest supplier of shipboard valves. 

“I was reading an article on all the great work that’s done up here and said ‘If I’m ever in Wisconsin, I want to see where these valves are made,’” said Howard. “You wouldn’t believe that a land locked state in the middle of the country would have such a strong tie to the Navy.” 

Milwaukee Valve Company has been in partnership with the Navy since the 1960s and provides close to 12,000 valves for each individual aircraft carrier.

Howard said that she wanted to emphasize to the employees how important their job was to keeping ships at sea so they can continue to defend the nation.
 
“We’re extremely proud to have Adm. Howard visit us today,” said Rick Giannini, CEO of the Milwaukee Valve Company. “The Marine and Navy business is an extremely important part of what we do so we are pleased that she wanted to come see what we do.”

Giannini is also the chairman of the Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base Coalition (ACIBC). The coalition represents approximately 400 businesses that supply components and services for U.S. Navy aircraft carriers.
ACIBC seeks to preserve the strength of the aircraft carrier force and promote the value of the Aircraft Carrier Industrial Base as a vital part of the nation’s overall defense structure.

319,NPS Welcomes Retired Vice Adm. Edward Moore Jr. Into Hall of Fame,"The Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) inducted its newest member, retired Vice Adm. Edward Moore Jr., into the university's prestigious Hall of Fame (HOF) during a virtual ceremony, Jan. 26, making him the 24th person to be welcomed into this revered community since 2001. As a unique addition to Moore’s induction, retired Adm. Cecil Haney presented Moore for induction following his SECNAV Guest Lecture to the university community.

Moore joined the U.S. Naval Reserves as an enlisted Sailor in 1963. In June 1968, he received his degree in Psychology at Southern Illinois University (SIU) and was commissioned as an officer. In 1974 he became a graduate of NPS when he completed his master’s degree in management.

According to Moore, his NPS education was beneficial in several ways, making him a stronger critical thinker and problem solver.

“I found myself using knowledge and analytical skills learned at NPS in most of my subsequent tours whether at sea or ashore, especially my Executive Officer and Commanding Officer tours, and my tour as the Personnel and Manpower division director for the Pacific Fleet,” said Moore.

Moore's service included commanding officer of USS Cowpens in 1989, where he was the ship’s first commander, and the first African American commanding officer of an Aegis-cruiser. While on the Cowpens, Moore led the ship, along with three other ships, in an attack on Iraqi nuclear weapons site in Baghdad on January 17, 1993. 

He then went on to serve as commander of U.S Naval Forces in the Persian Gulf in 1996, commanding the Carl Vinson Task Group and Cruiser-Destroyer Group 3 with successful missile strikes against Iraqi military sites in Operation Desert Strike. Upon his promotion to Vice Admiral in 1998, he became the highest ranking African American Naval officer on active duty through his retirement in 2001.

Moore continued to serve the Navy in a different capacity following his retirement, becoming Vice President for Anteon, and later General Dynamics Information Technology, providing personnel to engineering support. He retired fully in 2012 from the business.

He now continues his legacy by giving back to the community. He volunteered at Four Seasons Hemet Veterans Support Group and California Alumni Chapter of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc., helping homeless veterans and youth in Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California. He has been on the board of directors of the San Diego Fleet Week Foundation, San Diego Armed Forces YMCA, Navy Federal Credit Union, Surface Navy Association, and National Boy Scouts of America.

A compelling story, written by Moore’s son Edward Anthony Moore III titled, “Tearing Down Racism or Erasing Our History.”

""Amid the controversy surrounding the tearing down of confederate statues and the potential renaming of military bases, I came across an article that mentioned Carl Vinson and his historic support of segregation. It immediately dawned on me that my father, a man who attended school with the Little Rock 9 and their siblings during desegregation, had been stationed to command a ship named after a man who had directly opposed his equality,"" he wrote. 

""It was important for him to be selected because it proves that when brought to the front line, in the light of nomination, people cannot deny great people of their quality of work and consistency regardless of race, religion, or creed,"" said U.S. Navy Lt. Brandon Carter, am NPS student. ""For those who have been disenfranchised or marginalized, it demonstrates to them that the mindset of the powers that are shifting to become more accepting and understanding of hard-working men and women. Men and women who have had the energy to break down social and racial barriers while maintaining an extensive resume of sustained superior performance.""

NPS President retired Vice Adm. Ann Rondeau noted that recognizing the incredible service and accomplishments of our most distinguished alumni is an inspiration to the university and all those who serve.

“As a leader, warfighter and trailblazer, it is an honor to formally commend and induct Vice Adm. Moore into our prestigious NPS Hall of Fame,” said Rondeau. “Showcasing individuals who have attained the highest levels of public service and made significant contributions to our Navy and our society can only set the standards for all of us serving who dare to do great and remarkable things.”

""VADM Moore is the epitome of resilience and mental toughness,"" added Carter. ""He has gone from being an enlisted sailor to an officer, becoming the first black person to command an AEGIS Cruiser and reach the highest rank any black person in the Navy has seen and then continued to serve as a senior executive in the defense field. Even after all that, he has been able to still give back to his community because service has been that important to him."" 

In addition to his NPS Hall of Fame induction, Moore has also been inducted into the Arkansas Black HOF in 1999, SIU distinguished Graduate in 2003 and inducted to the Buffalo Soldiers Museum HOF in 2013.

“It is truly a humbling experience to be recognized by induction into the school’s Hall of Fame,” said Moore. “Thousands of students over the years have benefited from the educational, professional, cultural, social, and environmental skills imparted to them in their time here as a student.

321,Vice Adm. Brown Holds All-Hands Call at Naval Base Coronado,"Vice Adm. Brian B. Brown, Commander, Naval Information Forces (NAVIFOR) held an all-hands call for Sailors at Naval Base Coronado (NBC), March 5.

This visit marks the first time Brown convened such an event open to all San Diego area commands to speak about his increased role in the Information Warfare (IW) Community since assuming command of NAVIFOR in June 2018.

“IW is a warfighting discipline, a set of warfighting capabilities, and an enabler for all Navy mission areas,” said Brown. “It underpins every warfighting domain from sea to land, to air, to undersea, to cyber, to space. It is a complex network of human talent, machines, spectrum, and data that provides our Force with non-kinetic options, increases lethality of kinetic options, enables maneuver and distributed maritime operations, and delivers the home-field advantage at the away game.”

During the all-hands call, Brown presented on topics including IW integration into the fleet; manning, training and equipping personnel; the future of the IW community; impacts of the creation of the U.S. Space Force, and the expansion of IW Commander beyond Expeditionary Strike Groups to Amphibious Ready Groups.

“We’ve been charged with focusing our efforts on great power competition,” said Brown. “We went through many years of being the only superpower and now we find ourselves, over the last decade or so, with a rising China and rejuvenated Russia in a different kind of global competitive space than we had back in the 1980s. The ability to control information used to be much easier. Now we find ourselves in a time where information is the coin of the realm and how effectively we control information determines our ability to observe, orient, decide, and act faster than our competition. It's a much more cognitive space and it requires are different kind of fighting force.”

Brown also answered questions from members of the audience and presented outstanding Sailors and civilians with challenge coins, expressing gratitude for their hard work and dedication to their craft.

“It was great being able to ask a three-star admiral questions and receive honest answers on the spot,” said Information Systems Technician 2nd Class Jocelyn Rivas, a Sailor assigned to Naval Communications Training Center San Diego. “It wasn’t just officers and senior enlisted, it was a good mix of junior and senior Sailors. But my favorite part was seeing my peers being recognized on stage for their hard work.”

322,Vice Adm. Robert Sharp Visits IWTC Virginia Beach Students and Staff,"By Information Warfare Training Command Virginia Beach

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. C Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, director of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) visited and spoke with staff and students at Information Warfare Training Command (IWTC) Virginia Beach, Oct. 18.

During his time at IWTC Virginia Beach, Sharp met with the Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) “C” school staff and discussed the successful kickoff of the new Intelligence Specialist (IS) 2025 course. 

The GEOINT “C” school provides Navy enlisted intelligence specialists with the knowledge and skills to perform at the apprentice level as geospatial interpreters and basic strike support fundamentals afloat and ashore under all conditions with limited supervision.

Intelligence Specialist 1st Class Kalil Negronrodriguez, the lead for GEOINT “C” school, provided Sharp with a breakdown of the IS 2025 curriculum, which began Oct. 7. Negronrodriguez also shared how the instructors are training the students to develop more critical thinking skills with a deeper understanding of the end product.

“Vice Adm. Sharp was extremely personable, he listened to what the junior enlisted at IWTC Virginia Beach had to say and even knew some of his junior enlisted Sailors by name,” shared said Intelligence Specialist 1st Class Garrett Speer, a GEOINT instructor IWTC Virginia Beach. “He spoke about his vision for the future of GEOINT, was very supportive of working with IWTC Virginia Beach GEOINT team to get our curriculum up to NGA standards, and to give new GEOINT analysts a solid foundation.”

Sharp was also able to meet with students from the Naval Intelligence Officer Basic Course (NIOBC). He discussed being one of the first officers to attend the Intelligence Officer Basic Course at Layton Hall on Dam Neck Annex, Virginia Beach, and provided insight into the decisions that drove his career choices.  

“One out of three times in my career people said ‘do not choose that job or you will ruin your career,’” Sharp said.  “I tell you this; if there is something you are passionate about, go do it and do it well!  What is needed in our community changes often.”

Sharp also took questions from the students on a range of topics that included where artificial intelligence will take us, 3D printing capabilities and new capabilities such as Global Command and Control System (GCCS) 1.

He also provided advice. 

“In our profession, we get into senior situations quickly and you are growing the skill sets for those situations. Our warfighting skill set is making complex situations simple with intelligence support to operations and providing the right level of information,” shared Sharp.

“It was exiting to hear how our community anticipates the evolution of the intelligence officer in a time where our relationship with technology is increasingly symbiotic,” said Lt. Lydia Miller, a NIOBC student. 

Sharp closed by saying, “I wish you luck in dealing with the challenges ahead.  When I retire from NGA in 12 years [jokingly], I will be happy to know you are standing the watch.  I wish you continued happiness and success.”

“My personal thanks to Vice Adm. Sharp for taking time out of his busy schedule to share his perspective with our staff and students,” said Capt. Richard Bosworth, commanding officer, IWTC Virginia Beach. “We genuinely appreciate his interest in directly observing and discussing our training of the next generation.”

IWTC Virginia Beach, located in Dam Neck Annex, currently offers 65 courses of instruction in information technology, cryptology, and intelligence with an instructor and support staff of 280 military, civilian, and contractors who train over 6,500 students every year.

323,Vice Adm. Matthew Kohler Engages With IWTC Virginia Beach Students and Staff,"By Lt. Tiya DeGhetto, Information Warfare Training Command Virginia Beach

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. C Vice Adm. Matthew Kohler, deputy chief of naval operations for information warfare (OPNAV N2N6) and director of naval intelligence, visited Information Warfare Training Command (IWTC) Virginia Beach to speak with 24 Information Warfare Officer Intermediate Course (IWOIC) students, Aug. 5.

The IWOIC provides the concepts, knowledge, and skills necessary for information warfare (IW) officers to succeed in O4 milestone tours. Training focuses on the integrated application of IW at the operational and tactical levels of war. Senior officers provide mentorship on leadership and ethics.  

During this two week course, students are also provided senior-level instruction of the IW strategy and way ahead, followed by a detailed view of programmatics, state of threat, global force management, manpower and budget programs, video teleconferences with several IW flag officers and in-depth exposure to priorities and challenges affecting each of the individual communities.

""The purpose of this course is for you to see where you are going,” shared Kohler. “Have a mentor, reach out to leaders, and ask questions. Every tour is an opportunity.”

Kohler discussed the evolution of the IW community, from when it began in 2009 to how it will be celebrating its 10-year anniversary in October.  He also discussed the IW community’s footprint, and how it has grown to be over 12,000 personnel afloat.

The discussion then led to where the IW community was going.  

“The information warfare community is taking advantage of aligning ourselves with the expeditionary strike groups, like we did with the carrier strike groups,” added Kohler.  

He also recommended reading the following strategies:  Maritime Superiority 1.0 and 2.0, and the IW community s implementation plan, “Information Warfare in the Era of Great Power Competition.”

During the class discussion, he also emphasized the importance of cyber warfare as an operational arm of IW, and how the IW pin identifies IW personnel in a professional way.

“Vice Adm. Kohler’s discussion was an excellent ‘God’s eye view’ into the highest reaches of the information warfare mission and its key role in the greater strategic environment,” said Lt. Cmdr. Michael Nataro, an IWOIC student. ""It’s an environment that is constantly changing, and thereby forces us to constantly adapt in order for us to maintain the necessary advantage.” 

Throughout the discussion, Kohler also answered multiple questions from students such as:
-	Reserve enlisted IW pin requirements.
-	The proposed change from unrestricted line officer to line officer, and how it could affect promotion.
-	Is there a plan to develop a path for the IW community in the Reserve Officer Training Corps?
-	Are other services aligning to the Navy’s IW community?
-	What are the greatest challenges for the IW community?

“My personal thanks to Vice Adm. Kohler for taking the time out of his busy schedule to speak with our IWOIC students,” said Lt. Cmdr. Brielle Adamovich, executive officer of IWTC Virginia Beach. ""Exposure to his leadership and mentorship is a great opportunity for the next generation of information warfare leaders.”

324,NSSC Supply Officer Receives 2020 Vice Adm. Robert F. Batchelder Award,"The Navy League announced the selectees of the 2020 Vice Adm. Robert F. Batchelder Award, May 20.

Lt. Naomi Green was selected as one of the four recipients for the work she accomplished as the supply officer while stationed aboard the Ohio-class guided-missile submarine USS Florida (SSGN 728) (Blue) homeported at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Georgia. 

Green, who is currently assigned to Naval Submarine Support Center Kings Bay, said she is humbled by her selection.

“There are so many great supply officers, doing amazing jobs supporting our warfighters and ensuring we are ready for sea who are going unrecognized,” said Green. “I am grateful to be surrounded by such outstanding officers and am deeply humbled at the opportunity to be honored alongside them.”

The award is presented annually by the Navy League to Supply Corps officers who made significant contributions to operating forces’ supply readiness and positively impacted the Supply Corps.

Green, a Sacramento, Calif. native, says she joined the Navy nearly 22 years ago to do something meaningful with her life.

“I honestly feel like joining the Navy was the best decision I ever made,” said Green.

Green said she has received great mentorship and guidance throughout her naval career and credits her motivation to the people she works with. 

“Every day I strive to support those that rely on me, not to let them down,” she said. “Each morning I wake up and I get the opportunity to do it all over again.  It’s a very gratifying experience.”

Her advice to others who are working toward their professional goals is to keep pushing and stay positive.

“Try and recognize that tough jobs prepare you for the tougher jobs you will have in the future,” said Green. “Seek out relationships with mentors that can provide you guidance and career advice and be generous enough to pass it on to those around you.” 

The award honors the memory of Vice Adm. Batchelder, who served on active duty from 1917-1957 and retired as Inspector General at the Bureau of Supplies and Accounts, now the Naval Supply Systems Command.

Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay is homeport to all East Coast Ohio-class submarines, to include six ballistic-missile and two guided-missile submarines.

325,19 SFS Airman finished ADM training as first female in 5 years,"The coolness of the metal spread over the left side of her face as she gently laid her cheek on the buttstock of an M24 sniper weapon system.
 
“Send it!” The command was given. 

She emptied the hot air from her lungs, peered through the sweat dripping from her brow down the rifle’s scope as she slowly squeezed the trigger.

BOOM! 

The only sounds able to pierce through the foam barriers wedged in her ears were the commands given and the explosions of weapons being fired in the distance. The blast from the barrel jolted her back which caught her off guard, but she quickly regained her focus and waited on the next command from her spotter.

Senior Airman Jennifer Gamez, 19th Security Forces Squadron installation entry controller, qualified as the first female advanced designated marksman in approximately five years. 

ADM training was nowhere in the scope of opportunities for Gamez’s when she considered joining the Air Force. She worked as a civilian in the Lackland Air Force Base dining facility in San Antonio, Texas. After watching trainees day-in-and-day-out go through Basic Military Training, Gamez decided to join the Air Force.

From the moment she made that decision, Gamez began her journey of resilience.

She initially had a hard time finding a recruiter, but she didn’t give up. Once she found one, she struggled to pass the Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery test. None of those challenges discouraged her. She was determined to join the less than one percent of Americans who protect their country through military service. Eventually, she passed, and her new life to blasted into motion.

Gamez was put into the security forces career field, and although initially she was not too excited about it, she grew to enjoy her job. 

One day while Gamez was out working, she got a call to leave her post and come back to the squadron. Butterflies filled her stomach as she came to her flight chief’s office worried she had made a mistake on the job, unaware she was about to be chosen for a highly sought-after opportunity. 

“I was scared I wasn’t going to do well,” Gamez said. “One of my biggest fears is failure. My squadron was sending me and relying on me to pass, and I didn’t want to disappoint them.”

Despite her uncertainty, Gamez traveled to Fort Bliss, Texas, with another security forces member to complete training. 

ADM training qualifications rely heavily on individuals working in teams of a shooter and a spotter. To her surprise, Gamez’s journey of resilience continued when working as a team didn’t come as easy as she’d imagined. Being disconnected greatly affected the probability of qualifying, so she knew they’d have to dig deep and work harder.

“Your qualification is in your spotter’s hands, so they can fail you,” Gamez said. “If you don’t pass, you’re going home.”

Right before her first qualification, Gamez and her comrade came together, and like a well assembled weapon, their execution was accurate and unstoppable.

From that moment forward, Gamez and her partner went above and beyond to pass the course. The trust they developed for one another helped Gamez achieve the title “Best Spotter” and her comrade “Best Shot.”

“It’s awesome how we got better at being able to trust each other,” Gamez said. “Trust is everything when it comes to qualifying at ADM training.”

Gamez and her comrade completed their training and returned to the 19th SFS as advanced designated marksmen. Gamez overcame her fear of failure and realized she could do more than she ever thought she could. 

“They [19th SFS] chose me for a reason,” Gamez said. “They see something in me I don’t see in myself.”

Gamez continued to work in the squadron like normal until another individual came to her and congratulated her on becoming the first woman in about five years to complete ADM training. Shocked with disbelief, Gamez double checked the information, and sure enough, she was notified of this incredible accomplishment. 

Part of Gamez’s shock was the fact that no other female had finished the training she just completed in such a long time. 

She hopes that other females realize that if she can break through her fear of failure and complete ADM training, other women can too. 
“If I can do it, anybody can do it,” she said. “I passed ADM and know they can do it too.”

Gamez’s path of resilience gave her the ammunition it took to succeed. Every fear and uncertainty that crossed her path was one more challenge Gamez set her mind to overcome. 

“Whenever my mind is set on something, I’m stuck on it,” Gamez said. “I’m going to finish it.”

And she did.",2018/6/6,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/302895/19-sfs-airman-finished-adm-training-first-female-5-years,"LITTLE ROCK AIR FORCE BASE, AR, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国阿肯色州小石城空军基地,19名SFS飞行员作为5年来第一名女性完成了ADM培训,当她将脸颊轻轻地放在M24狙击武器系统的枪托上时，金属的冷气弥漫在她的左脸上。“快来！”命令下达。她把肺里的热空气排了出去，透过额头上滴下的汗水顺着步枪的瞄准镜往下看，慢慢地扣动扳机。砰！唯一能穿透她耳朵里的泡沫屏障的声音是发出的命令和远处发射的武器爆炸声。来自枪管的爆炸震得她背部发抖，这让她措手不及，但她很快恢复了注意力，等待着侦察员的下一个命令。第19安全部队中队安装入口控制员高级飞行员詹妮弗・加梅兹（Jennifer Gamez）获得了约五年来第一位女性高级指定射手的资格。当Gamez考虑加入空军时，ADM培训不在其机会范围之内。她在德克萨斯州圣安东尼奥市的拉克兰空军基地用餐设施中担任文职人员。在看着学员们日复一日地接受基本军事训练后，Gamez决定加入空军。从她做出这一决定的那一刻起，Gamez开始了她的恢复之旅。她最初很难找到一名招聘人员，但她没有放弃。一旦她找到了一个，她就努力通过武装部队职业能力倾向测试。所有这些挑战都没有使她气馁。她决心加入不到百分之一的通过服兵役保护国家的美国人的行列。最终，她通过了考试，她的新生活开始了。Gamez进入了安全部队的职业领域，虽然起初她对此不太兴奋，但她渐渐喜欢上了自己的工作。一天，当Gamez外出工作时，她接到一个电话，要求离开岗位回到中队。当她来到飞行主管办公室时，心里七上八下，担心自己在工作中犯了一个错误，因为她不知道自己即将被选中接受一个备受追捧的机会。Gamez说：“我害怕自己做得不好。”。“我最大的恐惧之一是失败。我的中队派我去并依靠我通过，我不想让他们失望。”尽管她不确定，Gamez还是和另一名安全部队成员前往德克萨斯州的Fort Bliss完成训练。ADM培训资格在很大程度上依赖于射手和观察员团队中的个人。令她惊讶的是，当作为一个团队工作并不像她想象的那么容易时，Gamez的恢复之旅仍在继续。断开连接极大地影响了排位赛的可能性，因此她知道他们必须深入挖掘，更加努力地工作。“你的资格掌握在你的观察员手中，因此他们可能会让你不及格，”Gamez说。“如果你不及格，你就要回家了。”就在她第一次获得资格之前，Gamez和她的同伴走到了一起，就像一把组装得很好的武器，他们的执行是准确的、不可阻挡的。从那一刻起，Gamez和她的搭档就不断地通过课程。他们相互之间建立的信任帮助Gamez获得了“最佳观察者”的称号和“最佳射击”的战友。Gamez说：“我们如何能够更好地相互信任，真是太棒了。”。“在ADM训练的资格认证中，信任是一切。”Gamez和她的同伴完成了训练，并作为高级指定射手回到了第19届SFS。Gamez克服了对失败的恐惧，意识到她可以做的比她想象的更多。“他们选择我是有原因的，”Gamez说。“他们在我身上看到了一些我在自己身上看不到的东西。”Gamez继续像往常一样在中队工作，直到另一个人来找她，祝贺她成为大约五年来第一位完成ADM培训的女性。Gamez震惊于难以置信，再次检查了信息，果然，她被告知了这一不可思议的成就。Gamez感到震惊的一部分是，没有其他女性完成了她刚刚完成的训练，这是她在这么长时间内完成的。她希望其他女性意识到，如果她能突破对失败的恐惧，完成ADM训练，其他女性也能做到。“如果我能做到，任何人都能做到，”她说。“我通过了ADM，我知道他们也能做到。”Gamez的恢复力给了她成功所需的弹药。她遇到的每一个恐惧和不确定性都是加梅兹决心克服的又一个挑战。“每当我下定决心做某件事时，我就会被困在上面，”Gamez说。“我要完成它。”她做到了。
326,Rear Adm. Kathleen Creighton Visits and Shares Wisdom with IWTC Virginia Beach,"VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. C The deputy commander for the Joint Force Headquarters C Department of Defense Information Networks (JFHQ-DODIN) visited Information Warfare Training Command (IWTC) Virginia Beach to speak with staff and students, June 25.

In her opening remarks Rear Adm. Kathleen Creighton said, “It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to talk to future leaders in our Navy.”

Creighton expanded upon her experience at JFHQ-DODIN, how DODIN encompasses all networks of every branch of the military, and the requirements to be a Joint Staff officer.

She answered students’ questions ranging from how to prepare and be successful in the information warfare community, the future of cyber warfare, information professional career path, future of the warrant officer community and expectations within the information warfare community.

On the discussion of how to prepare and be successful in the information warfare community,  Creighton said, ""Think about your network of people you trust, mentors or those you have served with.  Be willing to serve around the globe in tough jobs. I would suggest taking the path that creates the most balance.  Everyone’s path to success is different.”

Additionally, Creighton conveyed a few career “Pearls” that she has learned during her career:

1)	Career success is a team sport.
2)	Make informed career decisions and then own the consequences.
3)	Be where the decisions get made.
4)	Performance in milestone and command billets is what gets you promoted.
5)	Take care of yourself and your family.
6)	You’re a “1 percenter.

To conclude, Creighton said, ""Own your decisions and accept the consequences that come with them. Take care of yourself and your family; no one will do that for you.”

In discussion with the staff, Cmdr. Andrew Boyden, commanding officer for IWTC Virginia Beach, provided Creighton an overview of the command’s mission, vision, tenets, and course curriculum. 

“My personal thanks to Rear Adm. Creighton for taking the time out of her busy schedule to speak with our staff and students,"" said Boyden. ""Exposure to her leadership and mentorship is a great opportunity for the next generation of leaders.

327,Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Bill Moran visits SSC Atlantic,"CHARLESTON, S.C. C Adm. Bill Moran, Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO), visited Space and Naval Warfare Systems Center (SSC) Atlantic Nov. 9 to see the center’s capabilities and meet its workforce.

After several morning briefs, including an overview by SSC Atlantic Commanding Officer Capt. Scott Heller and Executive Director Chris Miller, Moran held an all hands call for the entire SSC Atlantic team. The admiral began by noting that when he graduated from the Naval Academy in 1981, the Navy had a goal of 600 ships, and neared that goal with 594 ships, with roughly 95 of them forward deployed all around the world. Today’s Navy has 276 ships and still has roughly 95 of them deployed all around the world.

“Today, we have the ability to know where the adversaries are, what they are thinking and what they are preparing to do. Our ability to do that is wrapped up in what you are doing here at SSC Atlantic with information systems that let us observe areas of concern, orient ourselves to fight, provide information to strike groups and make decisions rapidly so we can act before the adversary,” Moran said.

“The secret sauce is not the ships, it’s the people who deliver these capabilities efficiently and effectively,” Moran said. “What you are doing to design, develop, deliver and sustain the Information Warfare solutions helps us get the right weapons systems to the right place at the right time,” he added. “It’s like the blood running through the arteries of our Navy.

“What you do is incredibly important,” the admiral told hundreds of employees assembled in the SSC Atlantic conference center and more watching via VTC. “Technology is moving so fast in ISR, networks and cyber. You are now required to move faster than ever. You are innovating and thinking at a fast pace and partnering with the right people in the commercial sector to deliver the capabilities we need,” Moran added.

“I want it faster!” is the refrain from warfighters that is being heard at all levels of the Department of Defense, and the Navy is leading across the joint community in speed to capability, the admiral said. “You are essential to that mission, and I’m proud of what you are doing here,” he said. “There is no better service than service to one’s country.”

Following the all hands call, Moran toured the Common Submarine Radio Room (CSRR) where SSC Atlantic teams procure, design and test communications systems that are common across all submarine classes and enhance submarine platform mission effectiveness while reducing acquisition and life-cycle costs. The admiral then saw the Multipurpose Reconfigurable Training System, a PC-based, network controlled system with single-touch and multi-touch liquid crystal displays that simulate the exact equipment submariners use onboard the boat. It was developed at SSC Atlantic to train Sailors to use CSRR components. 

Accompanying the admiral during the Charleston visit were SPAWARSYSCOM Commander Rear Adm. Christian 'Boris' Becker, Program Executive Officer for Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (PEO C4I) Rear Adm. Carl P. Chebi, and Space Systems; and John Pope, executive director, PEO C4I and a former commanding officer of SSC Atlantic.  During morning briefs the VCNO learned about SSC Atlantic’s human capital strategy and Technical Growth Areas that support current and future fleet capabilities.  In addition, Becker and Chebi briefed Moran on the SPAWAR Strategic Vision. 

During a working lunch, Moran learned about several successful SSC Atlantic programs that address the Chief of Naval Operations goals, including model-based systems engineering, REDHAWK and Cryptologic Carry On Capability.  

SSC Atlantic provides systems engineering and acquisition to deliver Information Warfare capabilities to the Naval, Joint and National Warfighter through the acquisition, development, integration, production, test, deployment, and sustainment of interoperable Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (C4ISR), Cyber and Information Technology (IT) capabilities.

328,USS Jimmy Carter Officer Receives Rear Adm. Willis A. Lent Award,"BANGOR, Wash. (NNS) -- Lt. John Wayne Walker, from Houston, Texas, assigned to the Seawolf-class fast-attack submarine USS Jimmy Carter (SSN 23), was presented with the 2017 Rear Adm. Willis ""Pilly"" A. Lent Tactics and Warfighting Award during a Navy League luncheon held at Bangor Plaza, May 9.

The award, which is also known as the Pilly Lent Award, is sponsored by the Bremerton-Olympic Peninsula Chapter of the Navy League. The selection was most comprehensively carried out by many experienced submarine officers, up through the submarine squadron commander level and approved by Rear Adm. Frederick Roegge, commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC).

“The Willis A (Pilly) Lent award was established last year to recognize and honor the most tactically proficient submarine department head in the Pacific Fleet,” said Capt. Alan Beam (ret.), President of the Bremerton-Olympic Peninsula Council of the Navy League of the United States. “It is fitting that this year’s awardee, Lt. John Wayne Walker, is the navigator of USS Jimmy Carter (SSN 23); charged with developing and perfecting submarine tactics for the US Fleet. He is literally the best of the best serving on the largest and stealthiest SSN in the US Navy.“

Submarine commanding officers each nominated their top department head for this award. Squadron commanders researched each candidate and forwarded their top choice to COMSUBPAC. Roegge announced the winner in a Navywide message released March 20. 

“Possessing a relentless ability to turn any Sailor into a professional war fighter, he was a driving force behind Jimmy Carter being awarded the 2016 Commander, Submarine Development Squadron 5 Battle Efficiency “E” for operational excellence,” said Cmdr. Melvin Smith, Jimmy Carter’s commanding officer.  “Lt. Walker truly embodies the spirit of Rear Adm. Lent in his approach to aggressive tactics and leadership.”",2017/5/9,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/233479/uss-jimmy-carter-officer-receives-rear-adm-willis-lent-award,"BANGOR, WA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国华盛顿州班戈,吉米・卡特号军舰军官获得威利斯・A・伦特海军少将奖,班戈，华盛顿。（NNS）--5月9日，在班戈广场举行的海军联盟午餐会上，来自得克萨斯州休斯顿的约翰・韦恩・沃克中尉被分配到“海狼”级快攻潜艇吉米・卡特号（SSN 23）上，获得了2017年海军少将“皮利”A・伦特战术和作战奖。该奖项也称为皮利伦特奖，由海军联盟布雷默顿奥林匹克半岛分会赞助。此次选拔由许多经验丰富的潜艇军官进行，直至潜艇中队指挥官级别，并由美国太平洋舰队（COMSUPAC）潜艇部队指挥官弗雷德里克・罗格（Frederick Roegge）少将批准“Lent奖是去年设立的，旨在表彰和表彰太平洋舰队中战术最熟练的潜艇部门负责人，”美国海军联盟布雷默顿奥林匹克半岛委员会主席艾伦・比姆上尉（ret.）说。“今年的获奖者约翰・韦恩・沃克中尉是吉米・卡特号航母（SSN 23）的领航员，负责为美国舰队开发和完善潜艇战术，这是很合适的。他实际上是美国海军规模最大、最隐蔽的SSN中最优秀的一员。“潜艇指挥官们都提名了他们的最高部门负责人来获得这个奖项。中队指挥官研究了每个候选人，并将他们的最佳选择转发给了COMSUBPAC。罗格在3月20日发布的一条全球消息中宣布了获胜者。吉米・卡特的指挥官梅尔文・史密斯（Melvin Smith）中校说：“他拥有将任何一名海员转变为职业战斗机的不屈不挠的能力，是吉米・卡特被授予2016年潜艇开发中队第5战斗效率“E”级指挥官，以表彰其卓越作战能力的推动力。”。“沃克中尉在其进攻战术和领导方式中真正体现了伦特少将的精神。”
329,Adm. Harris and CIA Talk Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month,"CAMP H.M. SMITH, Hawaii -- Adm. Harry B. Harris, commander of U.S Pacific Command (PACOM), delivered a speech on Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month to the CIA Headquarters via video-teleconference May 8.
“It’s an honor to speak to you in observance of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month,” said Harris. “I’m sorry my schedule changed and I couldn’t be there in person, but this topic is especially important to me and I hope that I can give you all something to think about.”
	The month of May represents Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month in recognition of the first Japanese immigration to the U.S. on May 7, 1843. It also commemorates the completion of the transcontinental railroad, whose tracks were laid mostly by Chinese immigrants, on May 10, 1869. 
Harris has spent almost half of his Naval career in the Pacific. It’s not just the responsibilities of duty that makes the Pacific important to Harris; he was born in Japan to a Japanese mother. His father was an enlisted Sailor in the U.S. Navy.
“My dad’s sea stories formed some of my earliest memories and inspired me to serve, but it was my mother who taught me the true meaning of service,” said Harris. “While my father fought in World War II, my mother and her family experienced the cruelties of war in Japan.  She was from Kobe.  She lost her home, her school, some of her family members, and friends in air raids.  After surviving the destruction that war brought to Imperial Japan―as well as the post-war deprivations of the late '40s―she met and then married an American Sailor, my father.”
Growing in a culturally diverse family gave Harris first-hand experience on the ever-changing shift in diversity the world continues to experience. He feels embracing change, diversity, and inclusiveness allows growth throughout the military ranks to accurately depict the country’s demographic.
“I believe that embracing diversity is vital to both our present and our future,” said Harris.  “We cannot achieve healthy growth without it.  One former Chief of Naval Operations rightly said that as leaders, we must not be locked in time―we must anticipate and embrace the demographic changes of tomorrow to build an organization that always reflects our country’s make up.”
The military’s continued expansion in diversity through race, religion, sex, and sexual orientation has enabled opportunities for personnel from a variety of backgrounds.  The Pearl Harbor-based USS Chung-Hoon (DDG 93) reminds Harris of the ship’s namesake and the impact he had on the Navy.
“Gordon Chung-Hoon, a Hawaiian-born American of Chinese heritage, was the first officer of Asian Pacific descent to command a Navy warship, USS Sigsbee,” said Harris.  “In 1945, when a kamikaze suicide plane caused explosions and flooding onboard his destroyer, Chung-Hoon’s leadership enabled the crew to save the ship.  Awarded the Navy Cross for his actions, he was later promoted to rear admiral, the first officer of Asian Pacific heritage to make Flag rank.”
Harris credits the accomplishments of individuals like Chung-Hoon for paving the way for even further diversity and the increased perspective it brings.
“Diversity is about the power of choosing the best from the entire population―and not selecting the top of a sub-group,” said Harris.  “It's about new and different ideas that spring naturally from the attributes our people bring with them from their various walks of life.”
In his closing remarks to the CIA Headquarters, Harris asked the audience to value one another and to focus on what everyone has in common.
“I’m challenging each and every one of you to do your part in continuing to move our nation forward in the right direction,” said Harris. “That right direction is valuing each individual on the basis of their contributions. This becomes easy if we focus on what we all have in common―a love for our country.”",2017/5/10,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/233377/adm-harris-and-cia-talk-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month,"CAMP H.M.

330,USS Maine (B) Officer Receives Rear Adm. Willis A. Lent Award,"The award, which is also known as the Pilly Lent Award, was sponsored by the Bremerton-Olympic Peninsula Chapter of the Navy League and given to Medlin because of his outstanding tactical performance, individual achievements, and excellence in leadership as the best performing tactical submarine department head in the U.S. Pacific Submarine Force. This is the first time the award has been presented. 

""Lt. Cmdr. Medlin was selected for this award because, after competing with over one hundred highly qualified submarine department heads, he was considered the best in fulfilling the warfighting and leadership skills of Rear Adm. Pilly Lent’s legacy,” said retired Capt. Will Lent, son of Rear Adm. Pilly Lent.  “The selection was most comprehensively carried out by many experienced submarine officers, up through the submarine squadron commander level and approved by Rear Adm. Frederick Roegge, commander, Submarine Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMSUBPAC). I have met Lt. Cmdr. Medlin, and being a long time submariner myself, I fully concur with the selection, and believe him to be a most impressive young man.”

Medlin was recognized for his achievements by the Mayor of Bremerton, Mrs. Patty Lent, and the Secretary of State, Mrs. Kim Wyman.  His name was also engraved on a plaque that was presented to him at the Washington State Capital. Medlin will be honored again at the annual Armed Forces Day Gala Dinner, May 21.

“The award comes at the most perfect time to celebrate its namesake, Rear Admiral Willis Lent, one of the most outstanding submarine commanding officers of WWII,” said Mayor Lent. “Especially due to the christening of the newest Virginia-class submarine USS Washington (SSN 787) joining the fleet in 2016, this award will have a historical legacy for Sailors serving on Pacific Fleet submarines. It is very special that the first recipient is actually based here at Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor.”

Submarine commanding officers each nominated their top department head for this award. Squadron commanders researched each candidate and forwarded their top choice to COMSUBPAC. Roegge announced the winner in a Navy-wide message released March 22.

331,Training Squadron 22 earns Adm. John H. Towers Flight Safety Award,"The Order of Daedalians presented the “Golden Eagles” of strike Training Squadron (VT) 22 the 2020 Adm. John H. Towers Flight Safety Award during a small ceremony held at the squadron aboard Naval Air Station (NAS) Kingsville, Texas, March 1.

The award recognizes the Naval Air Training Command squadron that has made the most significant contributions to the Naval Aviation Safety program throughout the year. 

All student naval aviator and student naval flight officer training squadrons under the Naval Air Training Command are eligible to receive this award. Selection is based on squadrons’ safety records, quality of mishap reports and time between mishap reports, all while considering the number of aircraft being flown and number of days the aircraft spent detached from the squadron.

Order of the Daedalians National Commander retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Jerry Allen presented the award to VT-22 Commanding Officer Marine Lt. Col. Kevin Goodwin. Chief of Naval Air Training Rear Adm. Robert Westendorff also attended the ceremony to congratulate the Golden Eagles team.  

“Adm. Towers was a pioneer in aviation safety,” Allen said. “VT-22 compiled a remarkable flight safety record in 2020. You flew demanding sorties, accomplished carrier-arrested landings and deployed to El Centro, California, for weapons training. You took the initiative to conduct a host of safety programs to keep the focus on flying safely. This award reflects the hard, smart work of every member of the squadron.”

VT-22 has received the Towers Award four times, most recently in 1994. 

“VT-22 being recognized in this manner is a tremendous accomplishment and one that meets our mission of safely and efficiently training students,” Goodwin, a native of Milton, Massachusetts, said. “Our instructor pilots and students work tirelessly to ensure safety is the primary factor in our decision-making process. Every instructor and student is empowered to stop any evolution if safety becomes a factor or there is any confusion hindering safe operations. Essentially, if there is any doubt, there is no doubt.

“During a year that saw our flight hours reduced and COVID-19 fundamentally changing the way we operate, VT-22 rose to the challenge and optimized our training opportunities to overcome many barriers to production.” 

All CNATRA squadrons incorporate Safety Management Systems into daily operations. Operational Risk Management (ORM) begins before a flight is even scheduled, with the assurance that all personnel are qualified and current. On the day of the flight, each brief includes a discussion about potential ORM issues that may exist. Those ORM decisions are made continually throughout the flight in an effort to avoid unsafe circumstances.

“My command priority is safety,” Westendorff said. “There’s no mission we do to train an aviator or naval flight officer that’s worth unnecessarily jeopardizing lives. We always accept some risk when we fly, but with a safety mindset and by implementing ORM approaches, we mitigate those risks.” 

All safety issues and concerns are brought to the squadron’s attention as quickly as possible through a variety of means, including all-hands calls and checklists, to ensure all aviators are aware of new procedures and associated risks.

“Our CNATRA safety team develops and supports a safety-value culture in conjunction with high-velocity learning,” CNATRA Aviation Safety Officer Henry Schwerdtfeger said. “This is the foundation of our squadron safety management systems and how we continue to create the finest aviation professionals.”

Headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio, the Order of Daedalians is a non-profit organization that advocates for air and space power, and honors past and present military aviators. The award, named for Adm. John H. Towers who was designated a naval aviator in 1911, recognizes squadrons for their commitment to flight safety. Towers was known for many pioneering accomplishments during his career, including the establishment of the first naval flight school in Pensacola, Florida.

332,Navy Cyber and Networks Talk Fleet Cyber Security,"NEWPORT NEWS, Va. C The Navy’s Information Assurance and Cyber Security Program Office (PMW 130) and Tactical Networks Program Office (PMW 160) hosted a Fleet Stakeholders Working Group (FSWG) Jan. 24 to 26.  

Adm. Phil Davidson, commander, U.S. Fleet Forces, kicked off the event with a keynote speech.  Davidson noted the last two groups to return from deployment, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group and the Wasp Amphibious Ready Group, were actively involved in combat operations during their deployments. 

“Every group that deploys must be ready to employ their defense systems at any time,” said Davidson.   “U.S. naval forces currently enjoy advantages over our adversaries in the undersea domain, in networks, modularity and in people.” 

Focusing on the Navy’s advantages, he noted that Navy networks “enable naval fires and sensors persistent access to command and control so that commanders are able to employ the right platforms against the right targets at any time.” 

Davidson  also challenged the participants to develop battle management tools for the operational level of warfare that match the capabilities of the tools now employed at the tactical level.   

The three-day working group provided a discussion forum for afloat fleet representatives, fleet information technology (IT) leads (N6s), cyber operators and maintainers, resource sponsors, and supporting shore command and acquisition community personnel.  The objectives of the FSWG were to enhance awareness and to promote understanding of PMW 130 and PMW 160 programs, their capabilities and limitations in the fleet today, and plans for future.  The FSWG also provided an opportunity for direct user feedback, which was achieved through a series of panel discussions, plenary briefings and breakout focus groups.

Rear Adm. Christian “Boris” Becker, Program Executive Officer Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (PEO C4I), moderated a panel discussion which included Rear Adm. Nancy A. Norton, director of Warfare Integration for Information Warfare (OPNAV N2/N6F)/deputy director, Navy Cybersecurity, and Rear Adm. Matthew J. Kohler, commander, Naval Information Forces (NAVIFOR).  

The panel discussed the need for understanding network baselines and decreasing network and cyber-defense tool application times. According to Becker, “PEO C4I recognizes the need to make our programs more modular so we are able to reduce installation duration and enable installation outside of Chief of Naval Operation availabilities.”

Becker also challenged the 250 personnel in attendance to develop processes and procedures to modernize and maintain as quickly as possible, recognizing the critical importance of networks in ongoing and future combat operations.  

“The FSWG is a very productive tool for the Fleet,” said Master Chief Petty Officer Richard Okrasinski, Submarine Forces information technology force lead. “As hard as it is for the Fleet Sailor to get off the boat or ship to attend, the opportunity to talk directly to the program managers, engineers and acquisition professionals is well worth the time. 

The ability for type commanders to bring deck-plate issues to the engineers and meet face to face is key to successfully solving problems.  I enjoyed meeting the engineers and program managers and teams that develop and help maintain our systems as we work together to solve the problems of keeping our systems cyber resilient.”

According to Capt. Kurt Rothenhaus, PMW 160 program manager, working with key stakeholders to align efforts is critical to the combat readiness of the Fleet.  

“We must maintain a focus that everything we do in PMW 160 impacts Sailors at sea operating, maintaining, and securing our systems in order to support the Navy mission afloat,” he stated.   

""What good are our networks if we can’t secure them and ensure their operability?"" asked Mr. Rob Diaz, PMW 130 program manager. ""Keeping an open dialogue with our stakeholders allows us to collaborate on our modernization efforts as we strive to secure our systems so commanders can communicate with each other during critical operations."" 

PMW 130 plans, manages and executes program resources to ensure continued protection of Navy and joint information, telecommunications and information systems from hostile exploitation and attack. PMW 130’s mission is to acquire and sustain cyber security products and services to ensure strong authentication, data integrity, confidentiality, non-repudiation and availability of network resources and information. 

PMW 160 is PEO C4I’s program office for tactical networks, providing operationally effective and cost-efficient networks for Navy tactical forces.

“I am incredibly proud of our team at VT-35 for being recognized with this tremendous honor,” Dennis said. “I can tell you the backbone of our organization is our 10 civilian employees, some of whom have been here over 10 years. Although none directly work in the safety department, they are the quiet professionals who allow the uniform wearers to focus on operations, training, and safety.

“Each and every Stingray had a part in the daily operations that allowed us to be recognized, to include our highly professional and extremely hard-working students. Our safety department is the conscience of our squadron and ensures that our pilots are briefed and ready regarding the latest hazard reports, pertinent safety information and trends in aviation safety. As for the rest of our Stingrays, there is no team I would rather be a part of and I feel blessed and lucky to have such a tremendous cadre of officers and civilians who keep the bar so high, making sure we do business the right way C every sortie, every day.”

Cmdr. Nathan Bitz oversees the safety program across the entire Naval Air Training Command and said VT-35 last received the award in 2005. 

“We are always striving to improve the Naval Aviation Safety Management System to continue producing the finest military aviation professionals,” Bitz said. “When we have the chance to recognize those who go above and beyond in support of this goal, it is an honor to do so.”

334,"Vice Adm. Brown Engages with the Fleet to Receive Feedback, Discuss Surface Force Vision","From Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs

Vice Adm. Richard Brown, Commander, Naval Surface Forces (CNSF), visited Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Nov. 3-6, as part of his waterfront engagement series.

During his trip to Hawaii, Brown toured guided-missile destroyer USS Preble (DDG 88) and guided-missile cruiser USS Port Royal (CG 73), conducted a surface warfare officer call, and a commanding officer roundtable.

“Everything we do is to build combat ready ships and battle-minded crews,” said Brown during the surface warfare officer call. “That means ships are materially sound, leaving no redundancy at the pier and crews ready to fight, win, and come home.”

The Hawaii visit is part of waterfront engagements by Brown. The engagements provide an opportunity for the fleet to engage with Brown, provide feedback, and ask questions about the vision for the Surface Force. 

Earlier this year, Brown visited Sailors in Rota, Spain; Manama, Bahrain, and Mayport, Florida. Throughout his visits, Brown discussed efforts to build combat ready ships and battle-minded crews, while preparing for the high-end fight. 

“We are the premier surface force in the world, second to none, that controls, succeeds, and provides combat naval power to our nation when and where it needs it,” Brown emphasized throughout his travels. “There is no other surface force that’s like us.”

The feedback from the waterfront engagements around the fleet has been positive. 

“When he visited our ship, he was adamant about fixing the important issues, such as focusing on a warrior mindset and bringing back pride in the surface community,” said electrical officer Ensign Andrew Maus aboard USS Preble.

335,"Vice Adm. C. Forrest Faison, III, Retires as Navy’s 38th Surgeon General","WASHINGTON (NNS) C Vice Adm. C. Forrest Faison, III, the Navy’s 38th Surgeon General, celebrated the culmination of 39 years of active duty service at a retirement ceremony at the Navy Yard in Washington, DC, Oct. 25, 2019. 

Secretary of the Navy, Richard V. Spencer presided over the ceremony, and former Chief of Naval Operations Adm. John Richardson, USN (Ret.), gave remarks. 

“I’m particularly grateful for the steady hand Admiral Faison provided in our military medical transformation efforts, strengthening readiness and increasing maneuverability. Thanks to his efforts and the hard work of all of our Navy medical professionals, the Department is better prepared to confront a complex world & respond wherever needed,” said Spencer. 

The ceremony commemorated both Faison’s career as well as the role of Navy Medicine in the support to the daily readiness of the Fleet and Marine Corps. 

“It has been the privilege of a lifetime to honor the trust placed in our hands by those we serve and their families,” said Faison. “The Navy Medicine team is ready and dedicated to doing everything within our power to provide those we serve with the best care our nation can offer so that each Sailor and Marine can return home safely and alive.” 

A native of Norfolk, Virginia and Cleveland, Ohio, Faison graduated from Rocky River High School in Cleveland. He went on to earn his bachelor's degree from Wake Forrest University in 1980 and received a commission as a Naval officer through the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS) in 1980, completing his medical degree in 1984 at USUHS.  He is also a board certified and a Distinguished Professor of Military Medicine and an associate clinical professor in pediatrics.

During his tenure as Surgeon General, Faison led the way as Navy Medicine redefined itself from a primarily military treatment facility-based care model to a readiness focused, critical wartime enterprise in support of operational medical platforms and enhanced Fleet and Marine Corps Operational unit integration.

Among his many contributions to improving Navy Medicine, Faison dedicated himself to ensuring Hospital Corpsmen were prepared to fight tonight as he directed a comprehensive review, rewrite and update of the Hospital Corpsman “A” school curriculum. His attention to the Hospital Corpsman trauma training curriculum leveraged civilian partnerships to augment the clinical and trauma training experiences to better prepare warrior caretakers for casualty responses. 

He established the Navy’s Global Health Specialist Program to ensure professionals who have global health experience, skills and training receive specialized certifications to fill key positions across the Department of Defense, interagency and international communities.  As part of this effort, Navy Medicine successfully conducted a trauma collaborative exchange with the government of Vietnam to provide emergency medicine services.  The resulting effort strengthened allied medical trauma capacities and provided Navy medical teams the opportunity to sustain their trauma skills in an unfamiliar and resource-constrained environment.

Faison also led the first deployment of the Department of Defense’s $4.3 billion electronic health record system “MHS GENESIS” at Naval Hospital Bremerton and Naval Health Clinic Oak Harbor, Washington.  The new computer system will be implemented at all military medical facilities to manage health information in a single health record across the continuum of care for service members, veterans, and their families.

As Faison retires, Rear Adm. Terry Moulton will serve as the Acting Navy Surgeon General until a new Surgeon General is confirmed. 

“As I close this chapter of almost 40 years of service, I know our Navy and Marine Corps is in good hands because they are in your hands. I know you will continue to do what you have always done since the founding of our nation: honor the trust,” Faison said. “I wish each of you all life’s blessings ahead and please know that you go forward with my deepest thanks and admiration for all you do.” 

Navy Medicine is a global health care network of 63,000 personnel that provide health care support to the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, their families and veterans in high operational tempo environments, at expeditionary medical facilities, medical treatment facilities, hospitals, clinics, hospital ships and research units around the world.

336,"Vice Adm. Raquel Bono discusses leadership, mentorship in visit to NUWC Division Newport","NEWPORT, R.I. ― When Vice Adm. Raquel Bono was a child, she often wondered why her father worked such long, late hours. Her family had immigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines when she was 6 months old so that her father could attend medical school at the University of Minnesota, and some years later he was working as a Navy surgeon.

One night, Bono waited up to see her father before going to bed and the two had a conversation that left a profound impact on her life, she told Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport’s workforce during a speech held on May 10, as part of the command’s celebration of Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.

“He came home one night and I said, ‘Daddy, why do you work so long? When I grow up, I want to work at a hospital so I can see you every day,’” Bono said. “At the time, I didn’t know that girls could be doctors, but my father told me that I could be whatever I wanted.

“My conversation with my father really kick-started who I was and helped me to fulfill the opportunities that my parents gave to me,” said Bono, who is the first female, medical, three-star admiral in the history of the U.S. Navy, and serves as the director of the Defense Health Agency.

“I thought that was really cool until I went to get my shoulder boards; I had to get them special ordered,” Bono said. “I told them, when you special order them, don’t quite break that mold because I’m hoping someone behind me can use them too.

“I also take a lot of leadership from what I’ve learned as a parent, wife and colleague.”

Leadership and mentorship were at the crux of Bono’s all-hands talk, which was presented by NUWC Newport’s Equal Employment Opportunity, Diversity and Inclusion Office. From that early conversation with her father, Bono was inspired and has had a distinguished career in the Navy for more than 40 years.

In reflecting on her many years of service, Bono admitted that she could not have envisioned this path when her career began. “When my father told me I could be whatever I want, I had no idea that not only would I get to train as a trauma surgeon, but that I could also get to be a three-star admiral,” Bono said. “I had no idea what was in store for me. I can tell you, every step of the way eventually prepared me for the job I have today.

“You may not know exactly where life is going to take you, but you want to be prepared as you make your way on your journey.”

Leadership and mentorship played a critical role in that respect for Bono, and she shared some of the lessons she has learned along the way.

The ability to align in a direction that a group collectively wants to go and then to make things happen are two critical aspects of leadership, Bono noted while acknowledging the difficulties that process presents.

“It does make people uncomfortable, and the first thing that they’ll probably do is say no,” Bono said. “As leaders and mentors, you need to reflect on how you want to do it and how you are going to develop the skills to do that.

“As you look to your own leadership, help them develop the tools to create change in your environment, and then push forward within those lines of effort.”

An epiphany Bono had during her general surgery residency helped to illustrate this. At the time, she was the second female to enter the Navy program and the first to graduate. It is customary, Bono explained, for attendees to bombard the trainees in the operating room with a constant stream of questions to gauge their fundamental knowledge.

“I came out of there and was completely defeated,” Bono said. “I walked into the locker room and there was only one thing I could think to do; I was so overwhelmed, I got into a stall and I burst into tears.”

As she sat there in a stall in the women’s locker room, it occurred to Bono that her colleagues in the men’s locker room would have had time to talk about the case before they entered the operating room.

“Rather than make it about that, I thought, ‘what do I need to do to close the gap? If I’m going through this, who else is going through the same level of frustration? What can I do to make it better for [women]?’” Bono said. “I made a commitment to myself to try to make it easier for them. That’s a large part of what being a mentor is all about.”

A few years later, it was Bono’s turn to be the attendee who was grilling a trainee. Sure enough, after the surgery, she found the overwhelmed woman sobbing in a bathroom stall.

“I put my hand over the stall, said, ‘give me your beeper, take a few hours and come back when you feel better because what you need is time and perspective,’” Bono said. “I wish someone would have done that for me. I’ve oriented my career in knowing what I can do to make things better for people ― even if it’s a moment for a quiet cry.

“I can be that safe harbor to vent. Sometimes, all you need to do is to be able to hear yourself out loud. I will listen to whatever they need me to listen to. What I’ve found is most people just need to talk out loud and get a few nudges.”

In addition to her experiences, Bono also noted that her family’s military legacy has shaped her views of leadership and mentorship. Her grandfather served in the U.S. Army and retired as a colonel, while her brother is retired Rear Adm. Anatolio B. Cruz III. Bono and Cruz III are the only siblings of Filipino descent to hold flag-officer rank simultaneously.

“As a leader and mentor, the most important thing is understanding that I serve a greater mission than myself,” Bono said. “My father wanted to make sure that we gave back to the country we adopted. I am here to serve others and understand how best to serve others so that they can make better things happen.

“When I see organizations such as [NUWC Newport] where you have the same attention to detail, it not only resonates with me, it also encourages me that this is the best model. It’s a hallmark of our military and Navy. We build our strength on knowing that we serve each other.”

These are lessons she has instilled not just in coworkers but in her children as well. Bono described a moment similar to the one she had with her own father when one of her daughters was 7 years old. 

“I told her what it’s like to be a doctor and medical officer. We talked about what it’s like to meet people that need your help,” Bono said. “I also explained that as a naval officer, I serve our country, I am part of a group of Sailors ― 300,000 across the world ― and how important it is to be a part of the military.

“My daughter is dialed in on me, and that was one of my moments. She said to me when I was finished, ‘Momma, can boys be doctors too?’”

337,FCC/C10F Intelligence Officer Receives Rear Adm. Edwin T. Layton Award,"FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. (NNS) - Cmdr. David Varona, deputy assistant chief of staff for intelligence, U.S. Fleet Cyber Command / U.S. 10th Fleet (FCC/C10F), was named as one of the recipients of this year’s Rear Adm. Edwin T. Layton Award for Leadership and Mentorship.

“I am truly honored and humbled to have received this award,” said Varona. “Some of the most impressive officers I've been honored to serve with were former winners, three here at FCC/C10F alone.  The naval intelligence community has always had strong leaders, so to be selected for this recognition is extremely humbling.

Established by the Director of Naval Intelligence in 2001, the Rear Adm. Edwin T. Layton Award for Leadership and Mentorship recognizes Sailors for outstanding leadership and mentorship in the furtherance on naval intelligence performance. The awardees have exemplified the leadership qualities of honor, courage, and commitment. Furthermore, each have been clearly recognized as a model leader for the naval intelligence community.

Varona emphasized his selection reflected the successes of his fellow shipmates at FCC/C10F. 

“My selection speaks more to the successes of the team I am a part of than anything I've done individually,” said Varona. “We are truly fortunate to have some of the best from the Navy intelligence community right here at FCC/C10F, be it civilians, officers, chief petty officers, and our junior enlisted. This award belongs to the FCC/C10F team here and the leadership we have across the ranks.”

Captain John Watkins, chief of staff, FCC/C10F, credited Varona’s selection to his character.

“Although he gives the credit for winning the award to his team, Cmdr. Varona’s leadership and dedication to his team is why he was selected for this award,” said Watkins. “He makes my job easy. He is an incredibly talented leader with contagious enthusiasm and impeccable standards of personal conduct.”

When asked what leadership attributes are necessary for intelligence officers just coming into the community, Varona offered some advice. 

“First, always be sincere,” said Varona. “This is what I’ve anchored on in my own approach to leadership.  If you are honest with your team and honest with your leadership, your intent and desire will be clear and you can focus on the mission. Second, be professionally inquisitive. The credibility you need to do your job effectively is not something easily attainable in standard work hours. Take the time to read and learn.  It will pay dividends for you. Third, and finally, lean on your senior enlisted. Get out and talk to people, get buy in and perspective from your senior enlisted and listen to what they have to say.  The corporate knowledge inherent in our workforce is astounding, and your teams can do amazing things when they are empowered and feel they own part of the solution.”

Rear Adm. Edwin T. Layton, the award's namesake, was primarily known for his code-breaking techniques in support of Adm. Chester Nimitz during World War II. His techniques ultimately contributed to providing information that was vital to winning the Battle of Midway. 

Varona also emphasized the importance of family and mentors making an invaluable difference in his career. 

“The success I’ve enjoyed this far would not have happened without the support of my family, my kids, the constant sacrifice of my wife in particular, and the support of my parents,” said Varona. “The people closest to me gave me the confidence to believe in myself from the start. I've had several professional role models I've looked up to in my career, most notably Capt. Jason Hines and Capt. Craig Whittinghill from within our community, and plenty of others from without.”   

FCC is responsible for Navy information network operations, offensive and defensive cyberspace operations, space operations and signals intelligence.  Comprised of over 14,000 Sailors, Reservists and civilians stationed across the world, C10F is the operational arm of FCC and executes its mission through a task force structure similar to other warfare commanders.

338,Rear Adm. Robert Hayes becomes Director of Joint Interagency Task Force West,"HONOLULU - Joint Interagency Task Force West held its 18th change of command ceremony bidding farewell to U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Donna L. Cottrell and welcoming Rear Adm. Robert P. Hayes, at Camp H. M. Smith, April 12.
Cottrell, a native of Wellington, Ohio, served as the Director of Joint Interagency Task Force West from March 2017 to April 2019.  She will be reporting as Commander to U.S. Coast Guard District Nine, in Cleveland, Ohio.
During Cottrell’s tenure as director, Joint Interagency Task Force West analysts identified suspect shipping events that led to several successful joint law enforcement operations seizing approximately four metric tons of cocaine, two metric tons of methamphetamine, and 90 metric tons of precursor chemicals.  Working with regional partners, she initiated a new cooperative effort with partner nations operating in the Pacific through exercise PACIFIC SNOW, a first for the Task Force, leading to increased intelligence sharing to combat the flow of transnational crime in the region.

Under Rear Adm. Cottrell’s watch, Joint Interagency Task Force West received the U.S. Interdiction Coordinator Award for its efforts in assisting law enforcement with the shutdown of the largest illicit dark web marketplace, Alpha Bay, and the arrest of the administrator and co-conspirators.

Incoming director Rear Adm. Hayes, a native of Connecticut, has over 30 years of service.

339,Rear Adm. Christopher Alexander Assumes Command of Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center,"Rear Adm. Christopher Alexander, a native of Key West, Fla., assumed command of Naval Surface and Mine Warfighting Development Center (SMWDC), headquartered in San Diego, May 10th without a change of command ceremony due to his predecessor being transferred ahead of Alexander’s arrival to fill an urgent operational role.

Prior to SMWDC, Alexander was most recently the Commanding Officer of Surface Warfare Schools Command located onboard Naval Station Newport, R.I.

Alexander is the fifth SMWDC Commander since its 2015 establishment as the Surface Warfare community’s Warfighting Development Center.

“I am truly humbled and honored to assume command of SMWDC. To be able to work with some of the best surface warfare tacticians to build and refine doctrine, tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP) for the Surface Warfare community is an immense and exciting opportunity. SMWDC has been in great hands with the Commanders who have come before me and I am excited to see where we will go in the future,” said Alexander.  

SMWDC is designated the Executive Agent for and responsible to Commander, Naval Surface Force, U.S. Pacific Fleet (COMNAVSURFPAC), for Surface Warfare Combat Training Continuum (SWCTC) planning, development, and implementation, including management of the Warfare Tactics Instructor (WTI) program, Surface Tactical Training Syllabi (STTS), and the associated Training and Readiness matrix.

“The Surface Force rolled out a six-month SWCTC pilot program aboard two destroyers this year, to test the DDG 51 STTS and tactical action officer grading criteria,” said Alexander. “The data from this pilot will aid in the follow-on implementation of SWCTC which will result in an automated system that tracks qualifications, currency, proficiency and experience throughout a watchstander’s career.”

A great deal of SMWDC’s planning and execution is accomplished by WTIs, the top-talented Surface Warfare officers that applied, selected and trained to become warfighting experts, in one of four surface warfare areas C amphibious warfare, integrated air and missile defense, mine warfare or anti-submarine warfare / surface warfare. WTIs plan and execute Surface Warfare Advanced Tactical Training (SWATT) exercises with increasing complexity that continues to challenge surface combatants and their crews to become more proficient and lethal at the individual, watch team, unit and strike group levels. These exercises ultimately foster battle-minded crews and combat ready ship for the high-end fight.

340,"Rear Adm. Christina Alvarado Talks Leadership, Hispanic Heritage at LATINA Style Symposium","WASHINGTON (NNS) -- Rear Adm. Christina (Tina) Alvarado, deputy chief for Reserve policy, U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, joined five Hispanic military leaders for a panel at the National LATINA Style Awards to offer guidance and advice on leadership and self-development.

 Alvarado's journey into the military was an unconventional one. She worked as a critical care nurse before moving to Washington, D.C. as a full-time staffer at the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, following the footsteps of her biological grandmother, who was one of the first female staffers on Capitol Hill. The veterans she met inspired her to join the Navy as a Reserve critical care nurse. Shortly thereafter, she deployed to Operation Desert Storm.

 She went on to establish Navy Medicine's first reserve expeditionary medical facility (EMF), EMF Dallas in 2011. She was the first nurse to serve as the commanding officer of what was once a ""fleet hospital"" and one of the first women to do so as well. She and her team were given the honor of plankowners as the first Sailors to staff the EMF. Since that time, a total of four Reserve EMFs have been created within Navy Medicine.

 ""Having the honor of being a commanding officer with a team that accomplished a first like that was enormously satisfying,"" Alvarado said. ""There aren't many positions to go post-command, so I thought it'd be my last one and I'd retire as a captain.""

 Shortly thereafter she picked up her first star for rear admiral lower half, and five years later, with her second star, she's still serving as Navy Reservist.

 During the LATINA Style panel, Alvarado told the group about a young Hispanic woman and Navy nurse she recently met. It was this officer's first time interacting with a flag officer. The woman expressed her admiration for Alvarado, and said, ""You've made me realize that someday I may have the opportunity to be in your position.""

 That statement is one that has changed Alvarado's perspective on the importance of her role as a leader.

 ""At that moment, I started to wear my stars differently,"" Alvarado said. ""Holding a position of leadership isn't about the person in the position or the traditions of honor that come along with it. Rather it's about what that position represents for those striving to do better for themselves and those around them. I probably work harder now than I ever have before, because the young men and women of the Navy depend on me and I will not let them down.""

 ""Success is never a solo journey, and I never measure success by what I have done,"" said Alvarado. ""My success is measured by the accomplishments of those I've had the honor to lead. My shipmates in Navy Medicine have proven to me, through their accomplishments and the work we've done together in the last 29 years, that I have all the success I'll ever need.""

341,Rear Adm. Evans participates in Chicago Federal Executive Board Regional Congressional Briefing,"CHICAGO - Rear Adm. Stephen C. Evans, commander, Naval Service Training Command (NSTC), participated as one of the guest speakers for the Chicago Federal Executive Board Regional Congressional Briefing Monday, at the Federal Reserve Bank downtown Chicago.

The briefing was held to connect federal agencies in order to share resources and information as well as to present ways to enhance shared goals such as emergency preparedness, workforce development and government and community partnerships.

Evans highlighted the importance of these partnerships throughout the Midwest region and the responsibility of the Navy as a vital part of the community.

""We are particularly proud of our wonderful relationship with our neighbors,"" said Evans. ""With the help of the Chicago Federal Executive Board, our Navy is intertwined and fully engaged throughout the Midwest.""

The overall military economic impact in Illinois is approximately $13.3 Billion, providing more than 150,000 jobs for active duty, reserve military and civilian payroll. This impact accounts for nearly 2 percent of the state's gross domestic product (GDP).

Naval Station Great Lakes (NSGL) is the largest military installation in Illinois and the largest training station in the Navy. Partnering with federal agencies, NSGL plays an active role devoted to neighboring communities.

In 2014 NSGL raised more than $375,000 for area charities through the Combined Federal Campaign. In the past 12 years, NSGL has reduced energy use by 43 percent and nearly 70 percent of the vehicle fleet use alternative fuels. NSGL is also a leading blood donor in the Chicagoland area. 

Evans concluded by discussing the impacts of maintaining partnerships with the community.

""Our mission is training,"" said Evans. ""While we have no ships or aircraft at Naval Station Great Lakes, our capital asset is people. And we have some of the finest Sailors in the Navy training the newest Sailors in the Navy, many of them hailing from communities right here in the Midwest.""

NSTC, headquartered on NSGL, oversees 98 percent of initial officer and enlisted accessions training for the Navy, as well as the Navy's Citizenship Development programs. NSTC includes Recruit Training Command (RTC), Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) at more than 165 colleges and universities, Officer Training Command (OTC) in Newport, R.I., and Navy Junior Reserve Officers Training Corps (NJROTC) and Navy National Defense Cadet Corps (NNDCC) citizenship development programs at more than 570 high schools worldwide.",2015/8/17,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/173533/rear-adm-evans-participates-chicago-federal-executive-board-regional-congressional-briefing,"CHICAGO, IL, UNITED STATES",[],[],芝加哥，伊利诺伊州，美国,埃文斯少将参加芝加哥联邦执行委员会地区国会简报会,芝加哥――海军服役训练司令部（NSTC）指挥官斯蒂芬・埃文斯（Stephen C.Evans）少将作为嘉宾之一参加了周一的芝加哥联邦执行委员会地区国会简报会，在芝加哥市中心的联邦储备银行举行的简报会旨在连接联邦机构，以共享资源和信息，并介绍如何加强应急准备等共同目标，劳动力发展以及政府和社区伙伴关系。埃文斯强调了这些伙伴关系在整个中西部地区的重要性，以及海军作为社区重要组成部分的责任。埃文斯说：“我们特别为我们与邻国的良好关系感到自豪。”。“在芝加哥联邦执行委员会的帮助下，我们的海军在整个中西部交织在一起并充分参与。”伊利诺伊州的总体军事经济影响约为133亿美元，为现役军人、预备役军人和文职人员提供了超过150000个工作岗位。这一影响占该州国内生产总值（GDP）的近2%。五大湖海军基地（NSGL）是伊利诺伊州最大的军事设施，也是海军最大的训练基地。NSGL与联邦机构合作，在邻近社区发挥积极作用。2014年，NSGL通过联合联邦运动为地区慈善机构筹集了37.5万美元。在过去12年中，NSGL将能源使用量减少了43%，近70%的车队使用替代燃料。NSGL也是芝加哥地区的主要献血者。埃文斯最后讨论了与社区保持伙伴关系的影响。“我们的任务是培训，”埃文斯说。“虽然我们在五大湖海军基地没有船只或飞机，但我们的资本资产是人。我们有一些海军中最优秀的水手训练海军中最新的水手，其中许多人来自中西部的社区。”NSTC总部位于NSGL，监督98%的海军初级军官和应征入伍人员培训，以及海军公民发展计划。NSTC包括165多所院校的新兵训练司令部（RTC）、海军预备役军官训练团（NROTC）、位于R.I.新港的军官训练司令部（OTC）、海军初级预备役军官训练团（NJROTC）和海军国防学员团（NNDCC）全世界570多所高中的公民发展项目。
342,"Vice Adm. Grooms emphasizes networking, sharing ideas during NNOA Tidewater Meeting","NORFOLK C Stressing that he “never passes up an opportunity to chat with those you care about,” Vice Adm. Bruce Grooms, deputy chief of staff for Capability Development at NATO Headquarters Supreme Allied Command Transformation, spoke with members of the sea services and military retirees during the monthly Professional Military Education (PME) meeting, presented by the Tidewater Chapter of the National Naval Officers Association (NNOA), on March 10. 

During his conversation at Breezy Point on Naval Station Norfolk, Grooms emphasized the importance of NNOA.

“NNOA is a wonderful opportunity for us C folks in uniform and retired C to share in a forum that can be helpful,” said Grooms. “There’s always someone in a room like this who’s been there. More importantly, there’s always someone in a room like this who actually cares. Caring is the first step in helping you over a hurdle.”

Also Grooms encouraged attendees to meet and openly discuss when they think they may be facing a challenge, comparing seeking assistance to making a phone call.

“It’s always better to make the 411 call C let me share some info C than make the 911 my life is on fire, emergency call,” said Grooms. “I can fix any 411 situation; 911s are hard.”

A native of Cleveland, Grooms graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy, where he later became the school’s first African-American commandant of midshipmen.

In addition, Grooms, who completed nuclear power training, has served in nearly every capacity aboard a variety of submarines. He is one of the “Centennial Seven,” the seven African-American officers who have commanded a ship in the submarine service’s first 100 years. Also Grooms was selected as the Vice Admiral Stockdale Inspirational Leadership Award winner for 1999.

Grooms provided career guidance as well. He discussed the importance of really knowing the data on one’s Fitness Report (FITREP) as one way to know where an individual stands at his or her command.

“The data on FITREPS should never come as a surprise,” said Grooms. “If you don’t know where you stand, then you don’t where you want to be.”

Grooms also reminded the attendees that the NNOA national conference will be held in July in San Diego, which often includes senior level leadership in attendance.

“Every year for the last several years, the chiefs of the sea services have attended the national conference because they care about it. But what’s been missing is you folks,” said Grooms. “I need as many of you to be there because what we try to do is have opportunities to talk about really important topics, and some of the senior leadership only get fleeting moments to talk to you about those important topics.”

343,A Crisis Leader -- Vice Adm. Diego E. Duke Hernandez -- Decorated Pilot and Hispanic Hero,"In the lead of a flight of Navy F-4B aircraft from the aircraft carrier USS Ranger (CV-61) into North Vietnam on Dec. 16, 1967, Lt. Cmdr. Diego “Duke” Hernandez’ orders were to destroy a heavily defended bridge, electrical transformer and motor maintenance facility near the port city of Haiphong.

As the flight leader, he had planned a two-prong attack to knock out the facility, but instead of leading the main attack, he took the role of flack suppression, selflessly exposing himself to danger, to pave the way for his squadron mates from Fighter Squadron 21 to deal the decisive blow on the main target. 

According to the citation awarding him the Silver Star -- the nation's third highest decoration for valor in combat Hernandez, ""silenced an 85-mm site near the Kien An Highway Bridge with a perfectly placed rocket salvo and then, while checking the other half of his group, sighted an active anti-aircraft site at Kien An Airfield,"" threatening his squadron mates. He chose to make a second flack suppression run, the citation detailed, knocking out the site and saving the mission. 

""As he pulled out of this run his aircraft sustained a direct hit which destroyed both hydraulic systems and rendered the control stick useless,"" the citation reads. ""With the stabilizer locked in the full up position, Hernandez flew the aircraft through a series of high G, rudder-controlled barrel rolls out of enemy territory.”

Once out to sea in the Gulf of Tonkin, Hernandez and his radar officer ejected and were quickly rescued.

That wasn't the only narrow escape Hernandez had during his two combat tours that saw him rack up 147 combat missions over North Vietnam and having two aircraft shot out from under him. 

His combat service would also see him awarded the Purple Heart, the Distinguished Flying Cross, ten air medals and three Navy Commendation Medals, all with Combat V devices. Along the way he racked up 5,732 flight hours and 750 carrier landings.

Born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico, Hernandez was the son of two working class schoolteachers.  His love of reading and continuous learning, a habit recognized for creating strong minds, great leaders, and military professionals, began with the subtle example his parents provided and set him on a path to be one of our great Naval heroes.

""I didn't plan to have a career as a naval officer, I saw a chance to get a free education in the United States and I took it,"" Hernandez said in a 2011 interview. ""When I was in high school in Puerto Rico, I heard the Navy gave scholarships to study in the United States,” referring to the Navy Reserve Officers Training Corps scholarship, which still remains as one of the premier commissioning programs available to high school seniors.

Hernandez would rise to command Fighter Squadron 84, the oiler USS Truckee (AO-147) and the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67).  As a flag officer, he commanded Naval Forces, Caribbean, Carrier Strike Group SIX, and U.S. Third Fleet.  He finished his incredible career as deputy commander of U.S. Space Command and vice commander of North American Aerospace Defense Command before retiring in 1991.  At the time, he was the senior Naval Officer of Hispanic descent on active-duty.

After his retirement, he served on the advisory committee for the Department of Veterans Affairs' Center for Minority Veterans, helped plan future transportation needs for Miami-Dade County, and even co-founded the Town of Miami Lakes Veterans Affairs Committee, where he called home.

Still, he never forgot his Puerto Rican roots. In 1998, Hernández testified before the Senate urging Congress to respond in the Puerto Rican struggle to achieve political self-determination as a state of their own, consistent with the sacrifice to our nation he and others like him had, and continue to fight, to defend.

Hernandez passed away July 7, 2017 after a long battle with Parkinson’s Disease.

Hernandez’s contribution to our Navy’s legacy came from his own words in that 2011 interview about an inner feeling all who serve on active-duty and in the reserves today can identify with:  “I was a professional pilot and naval officer. [It] was not what I did, it was who I was.”

344,"Welcome Aboard, Rear Adm. Selby! New CNR Takes Helm at Office of Naval Research","The Office of Naval Research (ONR) ushered in a new era of leadership Friday, as Rear Adm. Lorin C. Selby―a decorated submarine commander, naval engineer, and acquisition officer―was sworn in as the new Chief of Naval Research (CNR).

In a first for ONR, the change-of-command ceremony took place at ONR headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, but was streamed virtually to the wider CNR community, due to COVID-19 safety concerns.
 
Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Robert P. Burke was the guest speaker at the ceremony.

As the new head of ONR, Selby will oversee the roughly $2 billion Department of the Navy budget for naval science and technology programs. 
 
ONR supports science efforts around the world, from basic and conceptual research to applied research and quick-turnaround technologies requested by Sailors and Marines. Established in 1946 by public law, ONR’s mission is to “plan, foster and encourage scientific research in recognition of its paramount importance as related to the maintenance of future naval power, and the preservation of national security.”

“I’m excited and honored to take command of ONR,” said Selby, “which is an essential organization ensuring our Sailors and Marines are fully equipped with the weaponry and technology needed to remain dominant in the battlespace of today and the future.”

Concurrent with the duties of CNR, he also will serve as director, Innovation, Technology Requirements and Test and Evaluation (OPNAV N94).

Selby holds a Bachelor of Science in nuclear engineering from the University of Virginia―as well as a Master of Science in nuclear engineering and a Nuclear Engineer degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
He takes ONR’s helm after serving as the Naval Sea Systems Command’s chief engineer and deputy commander for Ship Design, Integration and Naval Engineering. That command is responsible for providing the engineering and scientific expertise, knowledge, and technical authority necessary to design, build, maintain, repair, modernize, certify, and dispose of the Navy’s ships, submarines, and associated warfare systems.

“ONR is rightly celebrated as the Navy’s leading science and technology organization,” he said. “I hope to build on that legacy by stimulating collaboration and partnerships that will enable our warfighters to tackle the challenges of 21st-century warfare.”

Selby succeeds Rear Adm. David J. Hahn, himself a decorated submarine commander and acquisition officer, who is retiring after a distinguished naval career.
 
During his tenure as CNR, Hahn promoted a vision to significantly unify and enhance the relevance and responsiveness of ONR to the Department of the Navy. This involved investing in the right scientists to ensure the Navy and Marine Corps are always linked to scientific discovery; providing a steady infusion of relevant technology into existing programs of record; and disrupting adversaries’ calculus through innovative capabilities. 
 
Hahn accelerated development in such areas as directed-energy weapons, cyber, artificial intelligence, and autonomous vehicles.
 
Hahn said ONR will be in excellent hands with Selby.
 
“Rear Adm. Selby brings to ONR dynamic leadership, a strong engineering background, and invaluable experience in the federal acquisition process,” said Hahn. “In this time of increased competition with emergent powers, he is the right person to lead the command as it continues to enhance the scientific and technological capabilities of the Navy and Marine Corps.”

345,‘Tropic Lightning’ Soldiers earn coveted EIB,"SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, Hawaii ― More than 160 Soldiers were awarded the prestigious Expert Infantryman Badge at F Quad, here, on June 15, 2018.

Infantrymen assigned to the 25th Infantry Division’s, “Tropic Lightning,” 2nd Brigade Combat Team and 3rd Bde. Combat Team, participated in the grueling weeklong testing. 

Command Sgt. Major Brian A. Hester, senior enlisted advisor, 25th Infantry Division, gave his remarks on congratulating the newly minted expert infantrymen.

“I’m very honored to be among such great Americans,” Hester said. “One day after the 243rd birthday of our Army, which has had millions of infantrymen serve and defend this nation within its ranks. In fact the first Soldiers in our Army were infantrymen.”

“This is a defining moment in an infantryman’s career,” he said. “Earning the Expert Infantryman Badge is a difficult task that requires the completion of almost 40 individual tasks. You mastered each one of these tasks and were evaluated against a demanding standard.”

The Soldiers also participated in an Army Physical Fitness Test, day and night land navigation at East Range, and a 12-mile ruck march around the post to earn the coveted EIB.

“The EIB was created in 1944 by then Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall, to honor the United States Army infantryman,” he said. “It was instituted to build and maintain esprit de corps within the U.S. Army infantry units.”

Sgt. Roynald Allen, infantryman, 2nd Battalion, 35th Inf. Regiment, 3rd BCT, 25th ID, described what he had to do to earn the EIB.

“The EIB was a variety of multiple tasks that I trained up for weekly,” Allen said. “I studied in my off time to better prepare myself. Once the time came I was able to actually get everything correct in sequence in order to get a go.”

Out of the numerous infantry tasks Allen had to accomplish at Area X-ray, he had to work extra hard at one of the most difficult event.

“I was worried about the patrol lane,” he said. “Last year I got a double no-go at the grenade station. This year I got my first time go, so I was really proud of that.”",2018/6/15,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/281426/tropic-lightning-soldiers-earn-coveted-eib,"SCHOFIELD BARRACKS, HI, UNITED STATES",[],[],斯科菲尔德兵营，你好，美国,“热带闪电”士兵赢得令人垂涎的EIB,肖菲尔德兵营，夏威夷-2018年6月15日，160多名士兵在F Quad被授予著名的步兵专家徽章。步兵被分配到第25步兵师的“热带闪电”、第2旅战斗队和第3 Bde。战斗队，参加了为期一周的艰苦测试。海军司令部中士、第25步兵师高级应征顾问布赖恩・海丝特少校在祝贺新成立的专家步兵时说：“我很荣幸能成为如此伟大的美国人之一。”。“在我军243岁生日后的一天，我军有数百万步兵在其军队中服役和保卫国家。事实上，我军的第一批士兵是步兵。”“这是步兵职业生涯的决定性时刻，”他说。“获得步兵专家徽章是一项艰巨的任务，需要完成近40项个人任务。你掌握了这些任务中的每一项，并根据严格的标准进行了评估。”士兵们还参加了陆军体能测试、东岭昼夜陆地导航，“EIB是由当时的陆军参谋长乔治・C・马歇尔将军于1944年创建的，目的是向美国陆军步兵致敬，”他说。“它是为了在美国陆军步兵部队中建立和维持团队精神而设立的。”罗纳尔德・艾伦中士（Roynald Allen），步兵，第二营，第35中导团，BCT第3团，第25身份证，描述了他必须做些什么来获得EIB。“EIB是我每周训练的多种任务，”艾伦说。“我在业余时间学习是为了更好地为自己做准备。一旦时机成熟，我就能够把所有事情按顺序正确地安排好，以便开始行动。”艾伦在X光区域必须完成的众多步兵任务中，他不得不在一个最困难的项目上加倍努力。“我担心巡逻车道，”他说。“去年我在手榴弹站被双重禁止。今年我第一次被禁止，所以我真的为此感到骄傲。”
346,Helicopter Training Squadron 18 Receives Adm. John H. Towers Flight Safety Award,"The Order of Daedalians recognized the “Vigilant Eagles” of Helicopter Training Squadron (HT) 18’s outstanding safety record for 2018 with the Adm. John H. Towers Flight Safety Award, May 17.

Cmdr. Kenneth Kerr, HT-18’s commanding officer accepted the award on behalf of his squadron during a ceremony hosted at Training Air Wing 5 in Milton, Florida.

The award is presented to squadrons that have maintained an outstanding safety record and made significant contributions to the Naval Aviation Safety Program throughout the year. All squadrons within the Naval Air Training Command engaged in training student naval aviators or student naval flight officers are eligible to compete for this award.

""We are constantly making improvements in our Naval Aviation Safety Program to fit a fast-paced and demanding field,” Chief of Naval Air Training Safety Officer Cmdr. Nathan Bitz said. “We are proud to have the op to recognize squadrons that meet and exceed these safety standards.” 

HT-18 received the Towers award in 2002 and has maintained a superior safety record since then. 

The selection for this award is based upon reports of Class A, B, and C aircraft flight mishaps, Class A and B aircraft ground mishaps, how much time the squadron spent mishap free, and the quality of mishap reports. Apart from the mishap report, the number of aircraft being flown and the number of days the aircraft spent detached from the squadron contribute to selection criteria.

“This is a commendable achievement,"" said Kerr. ""I am truly honored to accept this award, but all the credit goes to our safety department and instructor pilots.  It is their day-to-day decision making and grit that has allowed HT-18 to operate so safely, while simultaneously maintaining the highest quality instruction.  We are developing future combat aviators and their ownership of the mission makes me extremely proud to be a Vigilant Eagle.”

The Order of Daedalians is a non-profit organization that advocates for air and space power and honors military aviators. It is headquartered at Randolph Air Force Base, San Antonio. The award, named for Adm. John H. Towers, who was a designated naval pilot in 1911, recognizes squadrons for their commitment to flight safety. Towers was known for his many pioneer accomplishments during his career, one of which was the establishment of the first naval flight school in Pensacola, Florida.

HT-18, established in 1972, provides rotary-wing training and designation to selected members of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, along with various allied nations. Its primary mission is to transition student aviators through basic and advanced rotary-wing pilot training.

347,"Rear Adm. Chip Rock Recognizes NAS Oceana, JEB LCFS Public Works Department Employees","From Naval Facilities Engineering Command Mid-Atlantic Public Affairs

VIRGINIA BEACH, VIRGINIA -- Commander, Navy Region Mid-Atlantic Rear Adm. Charles “Chip” Rock met with Naval Air Station (NAS) Oceana and Joint Expeditionary Base, Little Creek-Fort Story (JEB LCFS) Public Works Department (PWD) employees, March 3, onboard NAS Oceana, to recognize them for their recent hard work and accomplishments.

The Naval Facilities Engineering Systems Command Mid-Atlantic public works employees from NAS Oceana and JEB LCFS responded expeditiously, Feb 2, to an emergent water main rupture that was immediately affecting the Lincoln Military Housing Wadsworth Shores. Working late into the night, they repaired the rupture, insuring the more than 600 families living in the complex had their water restored in a timely manner.

After a few consecutive days of rainfall and freezing weather, installations throughout the Hampton Roads area were dealing with multiple water line ruptures and breaks. The PWD Oceana team had already been working two other breaks on the Dam Neck Annex that affected multiple facilities to include a barracks.

The team was contacted mid-afternoon regarding the emergent ruptured water line at Wadsworth Shores Housing. After securing from the barracks repair, the team mobilized immediately to begin, what would be an all afternoon, late evening repair evolution.

“When support was needed for pumping operations to remove the water and enable necessary digging operations, the team ‘phoned a friend’ and received unquestioned support from their brothers at Little Creek,” said PWD Oceana Public Works Officer Cmdr. Lakeeva Gunderson. “To come out in the middle of the night without prior notice or knowledge of the situation, and stay with the team until repairs were complete is awe-inspiring.”

Gunderson added that the fact that any PWD employee would assist another PWD without hesitation for whatever and whenever, speaks volumes to the true relationships the teams have built over the years.

“This is what the production supervisors have made into a culture for our Hampton Roads’ Public Works Departments. The bond shared between the PWDs is undeniable,” she said.",2021/3/3,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/391079/rear-adm-chip-rock-recognizes-nas-oceana-jeb-lcfs-public-works-department-employees,"VIRGINIA BEACH, VA, UNITED STATES",[],[],弗吉尼亚海滩，弗吉尼亚州，美国,Chip Rock后方海军上将表彰NAS Oceana、JEB LCFS公共工程部员工,来自海军设施工程司令部大西洋中部公共事务弗吉尼亚州弗吉尼亚海滩――海军地区大西洋中部后方司令查尔斯・奇普・洛克海军上将于3月3日在海军航空站Oceana上会见了海军航空站（NAS）Oceana和小河堡故事联合远征基地（JEB LCFS）公共工程部（PWD）员工，2月2日，来自NAS Oceana和JEB LCFS的海军设施工程系统司令部中大西洋公共工程部员工迅速响应了一次紧急水管破裂事件，该事件立即影响了林肯军事住房沃兹沃斯海岸。他们工作到深夜，修复了破裂处，确保居住在建筑群中的600多个家庭及时恢复供水。在连续几天的降雨和冰冻天气之后，汉普顿路地区的设施正在处理多处水管破裂和破裂。PWD Oceana团队已经在大坝颈部附件上进行了另外两次破坏，这影响了包括营房在内的多个设施。下午中旬，就Wadsworth Shores Housing的紧急破裂水管线与该团队取得了联系。在确保营房维修安全后，团队立即动员起来，开始整个下午、深夜的维修工作。PWD Oceana公共工程官员Lakeeva Gunderson少校说：“当抽水作业需要支持以清除积水并进行必要的挖掘作业时，团队‘打电话给朋友’，并从他们在Little Creek的兄弟那里获得了毫无疑问的支持。”。“在半夜不事先通知或了解情况的情况下出来，与车队保持联系，直到完成维修是令人敬畏的。”Gunderson补充说，任何PWD员工无论何时何地都会毫不犹豫地帮助另一个PWD，这一事实充分说明了团队多年来建立的真正关系。“这就是生产主管为我们汉普顿路公共工程部门打造的文化。PWD之间的纽带是不可否认的，”她说。
348,Storied company guidon from Vietnam finds way home,"FORT HOOD, Texas C The small company flag C known in the military as a guidon C flew over an airmobile infantry company of 160 Soldiers during some of the bloodiest battles of the Vietnam War.

The guidon flew over Company B, 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, during the Battle of Dak To in November 1967, the Battle of Tam Quan in December 1967, the TET Offensive from January to May 1968, the A Shau Valley Incursion from April to May 1968, and the operations in the vicinity of the infamous Landing Zone Carol/Fire Support Base Ripcord from July to August 1968.
	
Friday, the guidon was formally presented to the company by the Vietnam veterans whom had cared for it for nearly 50 years. The veterans of Co. B., 2-8 Cav., who served from 1967 to 1968 in Vietnam, started an organization called Eager Arms, after their radio call sign in Vietnam, and meet regularly.
	
“Bandog Company was honored to have the Vietnam veterans of Co. B, 2-8 Cav. in our company area today,” said Capt. Joseph Dywan, commander, Co. B, 2-8 Cav. “It was an outstanding event where Bandog Company memorialized the fallen Soldiers of Co. B, 2-8 Cav., symbolized by the bestowment of the company’s guidon that they flew in Vietnam. The company is honored to be the recipient of such a sentimental icon, and we have it proudly displayed in our company hallway along with pictures that represents Bandog Company’s proud and valorous history.”
	
Vietnam veterans read a roll call of those fallen service members from the unit, and then presented the guidon to Dywan and 1st Sgt. Isaac McKee, Co. B, 2-8 CAV.
	
“We all agree it means a lot to connect to the active duty unit,” said Peter Genecki, a native of Helmetta, New Jersey. “It has been fantastic for us to return this flag to the company, one piece of the puzzle.”
	
The ceremony was important for the Soldiers currently serving in Bandog Company.
	
“Today was a good day,” said McKee. “Not only did we get to honor our Vietnam Co. B, 2-8 Cav brothers, we also got to reflect on their hard times and share stories of past and present combat.  Our Soldiers realized that a guidon is not just a piece of cloth, but a piece of history, and represents all the Soldiers who served under it.  Every Bandog Soldier who passes by the guidon that hangs in the hallway will forever remember the 126 men who died in Vietnam from 1965 to 1971 while serving with Co.

349,Rear Adm. Peter J. Brown visits FIU to speak with students about CSPI program,"MIAMI - U.S. Coast Guard Rear Adm. Peter J. Brown, the assistant commandant for response policy, visited Florida International University on March 4 to speak with Honors College students about the Coast Guard’s College Student Pre-Commissioning Initiative.

“It’s a way for college students to get their junior and senior year of college paid for,” said Brown.

The Coast Guard partnered with FIU to increase engagement for the Coast Guard’s overall officer recruiting effort and provide more tuition-saving options and academic solutions to FIU students and professors.

The CSPI scholarship program funds tuition for up to two years of college as a well as books, fees, full time Coast Guard salary, housing allowance and medical benefits. CSPI candidates are enlisted in the Coast Guard while enrolled in school and get a guaranteed slot in the Coast Guard’s Officer Candidate School upon graduation. Students enrolled or accepted for enrollment in a full-time bachelor’s degree program at a CSPI designated college or institution can apply for the program.

“We’re making an effort for our recruiting offices to get to students at the community colleges, and to freshmen and sophomores at FIU so they can apply for the program,” said Brown.

Brown said he asked to be connected with FIU because he understands how important relationship building is with our neighbors to the south. He particularly wanted to work with a Hispanic serving institution.

Brown signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Mark Rosenberg, the president of FIU, in 2014 giving an overall strategic vision for the partnership.

350,PACFLT cybersecurity conference highlights cyber capabilities,"By Mass Communications Specialist 2nd Class Tamara Vaughn, U.S. Pacific Fleet Public Affairs

PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii C More than 160 cybersecurity specialists met at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam Feb. 9-11 to discuss cyber readiness within the Pacific Fleet (PACFLT).

The Cybersecurity Waterfront Training Symposium, hosted by PACFLT, provided Hawaii-based afloat and ashore leadership and civilian cybersecurity workforce personnel with training and a better understanding of cybersecurity initiatives. The theme of the event highlighted the importance of “Bringing Actionable Cyber Capabilities to the Fleet.”

“We need the senior leaders to understand the importance of cybersecurity ... ” said Capt. Danny Sadoski, PACFLT deputy communications and information systems officer. “ ... that cyber is part of their business, and that it’s a warfare tool they have that they can use.” 

Adm. Scott Swift, commander of U.S. Pacific Fleet, kicked off the Navy information warfareCled event.

“Because of the context of the challenges we face in the Pacific, I am focused on two key areas, one is defense and the other is offense,” Swift said. “From a cyber perspective, offense is a national risk and that is why the authority is held at the national level. My focus is also on defense to improve cybersecurity for the fleet.” 

The information shared during the event was geared toward understanding and familiarization of increased volume and sophistication of cyber threats and to prepare to defend against these types of threats. 

“I think it’s important to have events like this to answer questions about cybersecurity,” said Ensign Aaron Fleming, USS Chafee’s (DDG 90) cybersecurity officer. “It has opened my eyes to a lot of things I didn’t know, in particular about the different cyber-attacks.”

Swift also emphasized the strength of the Pacific Fleet and the importance of cybersecurity, stressing a cultural change is necessary to be successful long-term.

“There will always be risk. Computers are playing a major role in nearly every aspect of our lives,” Swift said. “We have to attack and defend in the same way as our adversaries attack and defend.” 

The symposium provided an opportunity for subject matter experts to discuss state-of-the-art techniques and current processes to provide feedback aimed at improving cybersecurity practices around the fleet.

351,Marne Soldiers depart for Afghanistan,"FORT STEWART, Ga. -- Approximately 160 Soldiers of the Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, 3rd Infantry Division, deployed August 3, to Afghanistan following a final formation in Newman Gym on Fort Stewart, Georgia. 

The HHBN Soldiers will be among 250 service members from 3rd Inf. Div. serving as part of the U.S. Forces C Afghanistan National Support Element in support of Operations Resolute Support and Freedom’s Sentinel. 

“The division as a whole is there to support U.S. Forces Afghanistan and coordinate all of the support-type tasks for the entire theater,” said Lt. Col. Luke Richards, commander, HHBN, 3rd Infantry Division. “For the (HHBN), we are there to make sure the division staff C the commander and his staff C can do their mission.”

The HHBN Soldiers will provide administrative support, logistics, training and anything else needed to ensure division can accomplish their tasks in country, Richards said. They will also provide force protection of their own facility and facility maintenance around the compound to ensure operability for division Soldiers, he said. 

“We take care of all of those things that have to happen behind the scenes so that (the command team) can just focus on supporting the team that is out there in Afghanistan,” Richards said. 

Pvt. 1st Class Brendan Morgan, a signals intelligence analyst with HHBN, said he excited to do what he was trained to do at what will be his first deployment since he enlisted in the U.S. Army. 

“It is going to be good to get to actually go and do our job and do some good,” Morgan said. 

Morgan’s wife, Larissa, and 2-year old son, Padraic, were at Newman Gym to see him off. He said they had talked about keeping in touch through Facebook, Skype, email and FaceTime during his deployment. 

To prepare for the mission, Soldiers of HHBN ensured their proficiency at individual Soldier tasks, conducted live fire exercises and trained on the standards for where they are going, Richards said. 

The unit will also have a platoon of Bosnian soldiers attached to them, Richards said.

“For some of the younger team, this will be a pretty good experience for them to interact with other countries and other services,” Richards said.

The timeline for the day of deployment allowed deploying Soldiers to see their children off for their first day of school, Richards said. 

Family Readiness Groups within individual companies held trainings and town halls leading up to the deployment to provide Family Members of deploying Soldiers comfort through knowledge and understanding of the mission, Richards said. 

“Sometimes it is just a matter of knowing and being aware of what we’re going to do down there,” Richards said. “Everyone has their own image of how things might be.”

Richards said it is important to share the information to allow for a more common visualization of what will happen. 

“Even if you go to the same location 10 different times, it is going to be different every time,” Richards said. 

Brig. Gen. David Hamilton, deputy commanding general C support, thanked the “unsung heroes,” of the deploying Soldiers for their support in his final remarks just moments before Soldiers boarded the buses to Hunter Army Airfield to deploy.

“Our loved ones, our Family Members, wives, husbands, children, mothers, fathers, grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts, uncles C those who are here to support our sendoff,” Hamilton said.  “Those who have been here with us through thick and thin, those who are here to show their love, affection, respect, admiration for the hard work that our Marne Soldiers do.”",2017/8/3,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/243591/marne-soldiers-depart-afghanistan,"FORT STEWART, GA, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国佐治亚州斯图尔特堡,马恩士兵前往阿富汗,斯图尔特堡，佐治亚州――大约160名第三步兵师司令部和司令部营的士兵于8月3日在佐治亚州斯图尔特堡纽曼体育馆的最后编队后部署到阿富汗。HHBN士兵将是250名来自第三中导师的军人之一，作为美国部队-阿富汗国家支持部队的一部分，支持“坚决支持行动”和“自由哨兵”。第三步兵师HHBN指挥官卢克・理查兹中校（Luke Richards）说：“该师作为一个整体在那里支持美军驻阿富汗部队，并协调整个战区的所有支援型任务。”。理查兹说：“对于（HHBN），我们在那里是为了确保师里的工作人员――指挥官和他的工作人员――能够完成他们的任务。HHBN士兵将提供行政支持、后勤、培训和任何其他必要的东西，以确保师里能够完成他们在该国的任务。”。他说，他们还将为自己的设施提供部队保护，并对营地周围的设施进行维护，以确保师士兵的可操作性。理查兹说：“我们会处理所有必须在幕后发生的事情，以便（指挥团队）能够专注于支持阿富汗的团队。”。HHBN的信号情报分析员、一等兵布伦丹・摩根（Brendan Morgan）说，他很高兴能在入伍后的第一次部署中完成他接受过的训练。摩根说：“能够真正去做我们的工作，做一些好事，这将是一件好事。”。摩根的妻子拉里萨和2岁的儿子帕德雷克在纽曼体育馆为他送行。他说，在他的部署期间，他们讨论过通过Facebook、Skype、电子邮件和FaceTime保持联系。理查兹说，为了为这次任务做好准备，HHBN的士兵们确保了他们对单兵任务的熟练程度，进行了实弹演习，并按照他们要去的地方的标准进行了培训。理查兹说，这支部队还将有一排波斯尼亚士兵跟随他们。对于一些年轻的队员来说，这将是他们与其他国家和其他部队互动的一次非常好的经历理查兹说，部署当天的时间表允许部署士兵送孩子上学的第一天。理查兹说，个别公司的家庭准备小组在部署前举办了培训和市政厅，通过了解和理解任务，为部署士兵的家庭成员提供舒适。理查兹说：“有时候，这只是一个知道并意识到我们将在那里做什么的问题。”。“每个人对事情的发展都有自己的看法。”理查兹说，分享这些信息是很重要的，这样可以更普遍地看到将要发生的事情。理查兹说：“即使你去同一个地方10次，每次都会不同。”。布里格。支援部副司令大卫・汉密尔顿将军在士兵登上前往亨特陆军机场部署的公共汽车前的最后一句话中感谢了部署士兵中的“无名英雄”，感谢他们的支持。汉密尔顿说：“我们的亲人、家人、妻子、丈夫、孩子、母亲、父亲、祖母、祖父、阿姨、叔叔――这些人都是来支持我们送别的。”。“那些与我们同甘共苦的人，那些在这里向我们展示他们的爱、感情、尊重和对我们马恩士兵辛勤工作的钦佩的人。”
352,Travis marches to celebrate women,"With banners stretched wide and signs held high, more than 160 people marched in unison down Travis Blvd. to celebrate Women's History Month March 24.

The march, dubbed ""March for Women's History,"" culminated in front of the wing headquarters building, where Solano County Supervisor Linda Seifert served as the keynote speaker.

""This month we want to honor and recognize women that have helped shape America's history and its future through their public service and government leadership,"" Seifert said.

The county supervisor spoke about the ""three P's"" - a set of characteristics - which she says she sees most profoundly in women who shaped history and challenged barriers: Patriotism, Passion and Purpose.  

""There are many women who preceded us that made the impossible, possible,"" Seifert said. ""We can learn from them, we can appreciate them and emulate the tools they employed to advance in public service and government.""

Seifert mentioned influential women in military service such as Opha May Johnson, the first woman to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps, and Annie G. Fox, the first woman to receive a Purple Heart for combat for her actions as the chief nurse during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.

""Today more and more women, like all of you, are choosing military service as a way of life and choosing to place their lives at risk to ensure those of us here at home remain free and safe,"" Seifert said. ""We are truly fortunate to enjoy the benefits of that kind of patriotism right here in Solano County, where military service is woven into the fabric of our history, our values and our everyday life.

""There are nearly 2,600 women stationed here at Travis Air Force Base and I would say they truly inspire all of us on a daily basis, so I say thank you,"" she continued. 

Master Sgt. Shevaun Reighter, 60th Air Mobility Wing protocol superintendent and event coordinator, spoke about what it means to stand on the forefront of that inspiration.

""We all need role models to look up to,"" Reighter said. ""People are inspired when they can see themselves in someone else. As both a woman and an Airman, I aspire to serve as a positive role model to the present and future Airmen that will take my place. It is important to honor the present and remember the past, while paving the future.""

Reighter said that events like these band the members of Team Travis together for a common purpose.

""It was a superior demonstration of fellowship,"" she said. ""This was not a mandatory event, and yet we were able to fill the streets with representation from all three wings in the name of Women's History Month.""",2016/3/25,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/197406/travis-marches-celebrate-women,"TRAVIS AFB, CA, UNITED STATES",[],[],特拉维斯空军基地，加利福尼亚州，美国,特拉维斯游行庆祝女性,随着横幅的伸展和标志的高举，160多人齐心协力沿着特拉维斯大道游行。为庆祝妇女历史月，3月24日。这场被称为“妇女历史游行”的游行在索拉诺县主管琳达・塞弗特（Linda Seifert）担任主旨发言人的联队总部大楼前达到高潮。塞弗特说：“本月，我们要表彰和表彰通过公共服务和政府领导帮助塑造美国历史和未来的女性。”县主管谈到了“三个P”“-一系列特征――她说她在塑造历史和挑战障碍的女性身上看到了最深刻的特征：爱国主义、激情和目标。塞弗特说：“在我们之前，有很多女性使这一切变得不可能，成为可能。”。“我们可以向他们学习，我们可以欣赏他们，并模仿他们在公共服务和政府管理方面所使用的工具。”塞弗特提到了有影响力的女性军人，如第一位加入美国海军陆战队的女性奥帕・梅・约翰逊（Opa May Johnson）和安妮・福克斯（Annie G.Fox），在日本偷袭珍珠港期间，她作为护士长的行为成为第一位获得紫心勋章的女性。“今天，越来越多的女性，像你们所有人一样，选择服兵役作为一种生活方式，并选择将自己的生命置于危险之中，以确保我们这些在家的人保持自由和安全，”Seifert说。“我们真的很幸运能在索拉诺县享受到这种爱国主义的好处，在这里，兵役已融入我们的历史、价值观和日常生活。”特拉维斯空军基地有近2600名女性驻扎在这里，我想说，她们每天都真正激励着我们所有人，“所以我要说谢谢，”她继续说道。第60航空机动联队礼宾监督和活动协调员谢万・赖特上士谈到了站在这一灵感的最前沿意味着什么。“我们都需要值得尊敬的榜样，”赖特说，“当人们能从别人身上看到自己时，就会受到鼓舞。”。作为一名女性和一名飞行员，我渴望成为现在和未来接替我的飞行员的积极榜样。在为未来铺路的同时，尊重现在、铭记过去是很重要的。“Reighter说，像这样的活动将Travis团队的成员团结在一起是为了一个共同的目的。”她说，“这是友谊的一个极好的证明。”这不是一个强制性的活动，然而，我们能够以妇女历史月的名义，在街道上摆满来自所有三个方面的代表。”
353,822 BDS deploys in support of Task Force - Holloman,"More than 160 members from the 822nd Base Defense Squadron at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, deployed to Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, Aug. 28, 2021, to support the Department of Homeland Security’s Operation Allies Welcome.

The 93rd Air Ground Operations Wing’s base defense Airmen will provide an enhanced security presence to Task Force C Holloman.

The Department of Defense, through U.S. Northern Command, and in support of the Department of Homeland Security, is providing transportation, temporary housing, medical screening, and general support at least 50,000 Afghan evacuees at suitable facilities, in permanent or temporary structures, as quickly as possible. This initiative provides Afghan personnel essential support at secure locations outside Afghanistan.

The 23rd Wing’s 71st Rescue Squadron supplied the HC-130J Combat King II cargo aircraft to airlift the team and the thousands of pounds of cargo to Holloman after only a few days’ notification.

The overall mission of the base defense squadron is to provide the Secretary of Defense with a fully integrated defense capability which enables Air Force, joint and coalition missions against advanced adversaries in line with national defense strategic objectives while maintaining immediate response force responsibilities, said Maj. Timothy Finucan, 822nd BDS commander.

Simply put, if an area needs a stand-alone security function, this expeditious team can deploy at a moment’s notice and secure the area.

“We are at our highest state of readiness to go anywhere in the world,” Finucan said. “This movement was a little different than our normal taskings, but it’s what the Secretary of Defense and the country needed us to do, so we’re here.

“I trust my Airmen with my life,” he added. “So even though there will be challenges based on the uniqueness and sensitivity of this mission, I have full faith and confidence in my team and their level of professionalism.”

That professionalism translates well into their specific mission at Holloman: support.

“Our team is performing a very critical role right now in the process,” said Staff Sgt. Matt Hugaboom, a 822nd BDS member deployed to Holloman. “We are thankful for the chance to help, and we know that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. 

“We are touching so many lives by being out here,” he continued. “We are going to treat everybody as if they’re part of our own team, our own family.” 


The entire temporary provision effort ― housing, medical, security, transportation, food and supplies ― is housed under U.S. Northern Command and includes other pre-identified military installations to take in the thousands of Afghan personnel. 

“The 822 Base Defense Squadron’s motto is ‘SAFESIDE,’ which comes from a proud heritage of protecting Airmen and air bases dating back more than 50 years,” said Col. Danielle Willis, 93rd AGOW commander. “This mission is continuing that tradition by joining with the total force team to care for evacuees as they transition to a new life.

“We’re honored to be part of the effort, and I know our Airmen, Guardians, Soldiers, Sailors and Marines are doing their best to care for these people in their time of need,” she said.",2021/9/1,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/404515/822-bds-deploys-support-task-force-holloman,"HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, NM, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国新墨西哥州霍洛曼空军基地,部署822个BDS以支持工作队-霍洛曼,2021年8月28日，来自乔治亚州穆迪空军基地822基地防御中队的160多名成员被部署到新墨西哥州霍洛曼空军基地，欢迎支持国土安全部的“盟友行动”。93空地行动联队的基地防御飞行员将向霍洛曼特遣部队提供增强的安全存在。国防部通过美国北方司令部，并支持国土安全部，提供运输，在适当的设施、永久或临时结构中，尽快为至少50000名阿富汗撤离者提供临时住房、医疗检查和一般支持。这一举措在阿富汗境外的安全地点为阿富汗人员提供了必要的支持。第23联队的第71救援中队提供了HC-130J战斗国王II型运输机，仅在几天的通知后就将该队和数千磅货物空运至霍洛曼。基地防御中队的总体任务是：BDS第822指挥官Timothy Finucan少校表示，为国防部长提供全面综合的防御能力，使空军、联合部队和联军能够根据国防战略目标对先进对手执行任务，同时保持快速反应部队的职责，如果一个地区需要一个独立的安全功能，这个快速的团队可以在接到通知后立即部署并确保该地区的安全。“我们处于最高的准备状态，可以去世界上任何地方，”菲努坎说。“这项运动与我们的正常任务略有不同，但这是国防部长和国家需要我们做的，所以我们来到了这里。”他补充道，“我用生命信任我的飞行员。”。“因此，尽管这项任务的独特性和敏感性会带来挑战，但我对我的团队和他们的专业水平充满信心。”这种专业精神很好地转化为他们在霍洛曼的具体使命：支持。“我们的团队目前在这一过程中发挥着非常关键的作用。”部署到霍洛曼的BDS第822名成员马特・胡加博姆上士说：“我们非常感谢有机会提供帮助，我们知道这是一个千载难逢的机会。我们来到这里触动了很多人的生命，”他继续说。“我们将把每个人都当作我们自己团队、我们自己家庭的一部分来对待。”整个临时供应工作――住房、医疗、安全、运输、食品和用品――由美国北方司令部负责，包括其他预先确定的军事设施，以接收数千名阿富汗人员。“822基地防御中队的座右铭是‘安全区’，它源自50多年来保护空军和空军基地的光荣传统，”AGOW第93任指挥官Danielle Willis上校说。她说：“这项任务继续了这一传统，加入了全军团队，在撤离人员过渡到新生活的过程中照顾他们。我们很荣幸能够参与这项工作，我知道我们的飞行员、卫士、士兵、水手和海军陆战队正在尽最大努力在他们需要的时候照顾他们。”。

355,60 years in the air- The birth of a tanker legacy,"Editor’s note: This is the first part of a series looking back on the history of the KC-135 Stratotanker throughout the decades, leading up to the 60th anniversary of the KC-135's first flight in August 2016.

MCCONNELL AIR FORCE BASE, Kan. C More than 60 years ago, the idea of a tanker able to keep up with the technologically advanced jet-propelled aircraft was just that, an idea. The idea became a reality and the aerial refueler would go on to leave its mark for decades to come, not only here at the Air Force’s premier KC-135 Stratotanker wing, but around the globe as well.

“The KC-135 was born out of necessity and innovation,” said Michael Lombardi, The Boeing Company corporate historian in a July 2006 article. “In the early 1950s, Strategic Air Command was beginning to operate the new jet-powered Boeing B-52 Stratofortress that, with in-flight refueling, was capable of striking targets anywhere in the world.” 

The technological differences between the prop-driven KC-97 Stratotanker, SAC’s primary aerial refueling tanker at the time, and the newer, jet-propelled aircraft proved to be less than ideal.

“While the KC-97 could and did refuel the jets in flight, doing so was problematic due to the KC-97's low speed and limited altitude capability,” said Mark Morgan, Air Mobility Command historian. “SAC wanted a jet-powered tanker, which would enable the bombers to take on more fuel, at higher altitudes and more quickly, thus contributing to the success of their mission.”

To keep up with the expanding tactical and strategic air fleet, blueprints for the KC-135 were soon developed and transitioning to the initial production phase began at Boeing’s facility in Renton, Washington.

Manufacturing of the updated refueling tanker was underway by 1954 and the first KC-135A production model, serial number 55-3118, rolled off the assembly line in a ceremony on July 18, 1956, said Morgan.

Nicknamed “City of Renton,” the aircraft weighed a total of 275,000 pounds and had a top speed of 600 mph.

“They’re built like a tank,” said Col. Phil Heseltine, 22nd Air Refueling Wing vice commander. “They’re probably 150 percent stronger than anybody would have needed in an airplane.”

On Aug. 31, 1956, Aircraft 55-3118 completed its first flight at the Boeing facility where it was manufactured.

“[After final testing and modifications], the aircraft was delivered to the Air Force’s Air Material Command at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, on Jan. 24, 1957,” said Morgan.

Aircraft 55-3118 was the first of 732 KC-135s to show the impact these tankers had and continue to have on aerial refueling. After decades of supporting the mission, it was retired and is currently on display near the east gate here.

356,Submarine Squadrons Host Career Advancement Symposium,"GROTON, Conn. (NNS) C Command Submarine Squadron (CSS) 4 and (CSS) 12 hosted more than 60 Yeoman, Personnel Specialist and Legalman for a Career Advancement Symposium at Submarine Base New London, Nov. 21C22.

The symposium focused on bridging the gap between the ratings to empower Sailors with the knowledge and tools they need to successfully manage their careers while improving administrative services to fleet.

Symposium organizer Yeoman (Submarine) 1st Class Eric Opitz, assigned to the USS San Juan (SSN 751), said the rates are particularly important to the Navy because they control what motivates all Sailors: financial well-being of themselves and their families.

Optiz said the takeaway goal of the symposium is for Sailors to gain knowledge and resources that assure Sailors around the fleet are receiving the best administrative service possible.

“We need to close the knowledge gap between ranks within our rates,” said Optiz. “What I mean by this is our admin offices are only as good as the performance of our junior Sailors. As natural leaders, we can combat this by building our benches and training our Sailors.”  

Rating community leaders and enlisted fleet training managers facilitated the event. Attendees participated in discussions on policies, instructions, personnel management, changes between the rates and ideas that could improve administrative services.

“This training was important because we need our leadership and junior Sailors to constantly train and develop,” said Chief Personnel Specialist Sergio Garcia, assigned to Naval Station Newport, Rhode Island. “Polices and instructions are always changing and the only way to keep up is train constantly.”

Yeoman (Submarine) 2nd Class Adam Emig said the symposium was very beneficial, because Personnel Specialist and Legalman Sailors do not serve on submarines and so many of those duties are handled by a Yeoman (Submarine).

 “The training was a big eye opener,” said Emig. “It was really good training that covered a lot of problem areas that needed to be addressed.”

“This is a first of many Symposium to come,” said symposium organizer Chief Yeoman (Submarine) Vincent Butler, assigned to CSS-12. “We had a lot of positive feedback from Sailors that want see more training like this.”",2019/11/22,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/354410/submarine-squadrons-host-career-advancement-symposium,"GROTON, CT, UNITED STATES",[],[],格罗顿，CT，美国,潜艇中队举办职业发展研讨会,康涅狄格州格罗顿（NNS）C指挥潜艇中队（CSS）4和（CSS）12在新伦敦潜艇基地举办了一次职业发展研讨会，共有60多名约曼、人事专家和法律顾问参加，11月21日至22日。研讨会的重点是弥合评级之间的差距，让海员掌握成功管理职业生涯所需的知识和工具，同时改善对舰队的管理服务。研讨会组织者约曼（潜艇）一级埃里克・奥皮茨，被派往圣胡安号（SSN 751）航母，他说，费率对海军来说尤其重要，因为它控制着激励所有海员的因素：他们自己和家人的经济福利。Optiz说，研讨会的目的是让海员获得知识和资源，确保舰队周围的海员尽可能得到最好的管理服务。Optiz说：“我们需要在我们的费率范围内缩小职级之间的知识差距。我的意思是，我们的行政办公室只与我们的初级水手的表现一样好。作为天生的领导者，我们可以通过建造长凳和培训水手来解决这一问题。”评估社区领导和招募的车队培训经理为活动提供了便利。与会者参与了有关政策、指示、人事管理、费率之间的变化以及可以改善行政服务的想法的讨论。罗得岛州纽波特海军基地的首席人事专家塞尔吉奥・加西亚（Sergio Garcia）说：“这次训练非常重要，因为我们需要我们的领导和初级船员不断地训练和发展。警察和指令总是在变化，唯一能跟上的方法就是不断地训练。”二等舱亚当・埃米格说，这次研讨会非常有益，因为人事专家和立法者水手不在潜艇上服役，所以这些任务中有很多是由一艘潜艇来完成的。“这次培训让人大开眼界，”埃米格说。“这是一次非常好的培训，涵盖了许多需要解决的问题领域。”“这是许多研讨会中的第一次，”研讨会组织者、CSS-12的负责人约曼（潜艇）文森特・巴特勒（Vincent Butler）说。“我们从水手那里得到了很多积极的反馈，他们希望看到更多这样的培训。”

358,AFRRI Marks 60 Years as Unique National Asset,"“I believe the likelihood of a nuclear catastrophe is greater today than during the Cold War.” -- William J. Perry, 19th U.S. Secretary of Defense.

The Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute (AFRRI), celebrating its 60th anniversary in 2021, is responsible for advising and assisting commanders in preserving and protecting the health and performance of U.S. military personnel operating in radiologically contaminated battle spaces and urban environments. Through research, education, and operational training, AFRRI advances the understanding of the effects of ionizing radiation and develops medical countermeasures in line with 21st century national security threats. 

AFRRI, a part of Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USU), is a tri-service entity created in 1961, with the mission of carrying out the medical radiological defense research program at the height of the Cold War. AFRRI has been instrumental in responding to nuclear threats around the world and pushing the field of radiation sciences forward in the last 60 years as the United States’ primary source of military-relevant medical radiological research, preparedness, and training. 

AFRRI was established because of the threat of the massive Soviet armies pouring through the Fulda Gap and overtaking Western Europe during the Cold War.  

“NATO forces had to figure out how they might be able to use battlefield nuclear weapons to stop that massive assault, as well as how defending troops could protect themselves if they became the victims of nuclear devices,” said Army Col. (Dr.) Mohammad Naeem, director of AFRRI.  

The Cold War-centered mission continued for several decades after the institute’s creation. 

“The ‘60s, ‘70s, and ‘80s were the boom of AFRRI,” said Naeem. “It had about 300 individuals and was packed with scientists and doctors. Then in 1992, the Soviet Union fell apart and with the end of the cold war, AFRRI’s mission and survival became a topic of discussion by the top military brass and it was realigned with the USU.”

Despite the end of the cold war and the decline of the Soviet Union, AFRRI’s mission remains just as essential today as it was in the 1960s, said Naeem.

“I think after 60 years, we have come back to the same mission,” said Naeem. “The threat is either the same or increased; there’s another gap in Europe that’s similar to the Fulda Gap called the Suwalki Gap, and United States is once again facing the great power competition with near-peer adversaries possessing sophisticated and highly advanced nuclear capabilities.”

The radiological threats of today extend beyond nuclear weapons to “dirty bombs,” low-dose radiation, and toxic metal contamination, added Naeem.

“Dirty bombs  are traditional explosive devices attached to stolen or orphaned radioactive sources that disperse radiation into an area,” said Naeem. “The potential exists today for non-state actors to detonate one of these dirty bombs in a major urban center, and we need to be prepared to respond. We can help determine when it might be safe to reenter the area, and how to treat those at the scene.”

To combat today’s threats AFRRI focuses on three areas: research, education, and operational training.

On the research side, there are five main areas of focus: low-dose radiation, biodosimetry or radiation injury diagnostics, radiation-trauma combined injury, toxic metal exposure, and radiation countermeasures. AFRRI’s infrastructure, including its research nuclear reactor and other radiation facilities, can simulate the immediate radiation effects of a nuclear detonation, radiation effects of nuclear fallout and long term radiation effects in a post-nuclear detonation zone weeks to months. 
“AFRRI is a leader in radiological research, and we also have teams dedicated to worldwide education and emergency response,” said Army Lt. Col. (Dr.) Lien Senchak, AFRRI’s military medical operations (MMO) department chief. “Some of the specific field research we’re currently conducting focuses on the effects of electromagnetic pulse on medical equipment, thermal resistance of military uniforms, hands- free radiation detection devices and testing materials for dry decontamination in cold weather.”

AFRRI has been essential in the development of therapeutic drugs, which limit and treat radiation injuries, as well as high-precision biodosimetry tools ranging from novel assays to software programs. AFRRI’s researchers like Senchak and her colleague, Dr. William F. Blakely, a senior scientist who has helped develop multi-parameter biodosimetry models and radiation risk assessment tools, were instrumental in many of these accomplishments.

Scientists at AFRRI are focused on transitioning this kind of research into education and operational training by working synergistically with their MMO department. 

“MMO serves as the operational and applications arm of AFRRI, applying research and expertise to real-world problems,” said Blakely. “The biodosimetry group collaborated with MMO to prepare several guidance documents for the assessment of radiation-related injuries. Recently we’re also involved in the creation of a radiation risk communication tool, a one-page document to assist commanders in the field in communicating the risk of operating in a potential radiation environment.”

The department provides these education and training tools for students and leaders not only at USU, but around the world. 

“Understanding of radiation is pretty limited in the medical community and outside of people who specialize in the field,” said Senchak. “It's important for people in the medical field to be educated on early symptoms of radiation exposure so that they can triage patients. We have a team that goes throughout the world and trains medical professionals on the health effects of acute radiation injury, how to treat radiation injuries, and how to detect radiation and other harmful substances.”

MMO also provides rapidly deployable response teams that have addressed a variety of situations throughout the world such as the Fukushima reactor meltdown and the anthrax attacks in 2001, and stand ready to address new threats as they arise. The department assists NATO and other international organizations with readiness exercises and educational materials as well. 

Senchak, Blakely, and their colleagues take pride in tackling this critical mission, and thoroughly enjoy conducting research at an institution with such clear ties between science and real-world solutions.

“As a young scientist looking for a place to serve in my career I was attracted to AFRRI because it had critical resources like personnel from every military service, civilian scientists, relevant sources, dosimetry support, and cutting edge research technology,” said Blakely. “It has been a wonderful experience in my last 38 years to work at AFRRI and contribute to the enhancement of medical readiness to respond to a potential radiological incident. I highly recommend others to join us and contribute in our mission to preserve the health and performance of U.S. military personnel and protect humankind through research that advances understanding of the effects of ionizing radiation.”",2021/8/25,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/403867/afrri-marks-60-years-unique-national-asset,"BETHESDA, MD, UNITED STATES",[],[],美国马里兰州贝塞斯达,AFRRI标志着60年成为独一无二的国家资产,“我认为今天发生核灾难的可能性比冷战时期更大。”――威廉・佩里，美国第19任国防部长。武装部队放射生物学研究所（AFRRI）在2021年庆祝成立60周年，负责向指挥官提供建议和协助，以保护在受辐射污染的作战空间和城市环境中作战的美国军事人员的健康和绩效。通过研究、教育和操作培训，AFRRI促进了对电离辐射影响的理解，并根据21世纪的国家安全威胁制定了医疗对策。AFRRI是美国卫生科学军队服务大学（UU）的一部分，是1961成立的三级服务实体，肩负着在冷战高峰期开展医学放射防护研究的使命。在过去60年中，AFRRI作为美国军事相关医学放射研究、准备和培训的主要来源，在应对世界各地的核威胁和推动辐射科学领域向前发展方面发挥了重要作用。AFRRI的建立是因为大规模的苏联军队在冷战期间通过富尔达缺口并超越西欧的威胁。“北约部队必须弄清楚他们如何能够使用战场核武器来阻止大规模袭击，以及如果他们成为核装置的受害者，防卫部队如何能够保护自己，”AFRRI主任陆军上校（Mohammad Naeem博士）说。该研究所成立后，以冷战为中心的使命持续了几十年。“60年代、70年代和80年代是AFRRI的繁荣时期，”Naeem说。“它大约有300人，里面挤满了科学家和医生。然后在1992年，苏联解体，随着冷战的结束，阿法里的使命和生存成为军方高层讨论的话题，并与USU重新结盟。”尽管冷战结束，苏联衰落，纳伊姆说：“今天，AFRRI的使命与20世纪60年代一样重要。我认为60年后，我们又回到了同样的使命上来。”。“威胁要么是相同的，要么是增加的；欧洲还有一个类似于富尔达差距的差距，称为苏沃基差距，美国再次面临与拥有先进核能力的近邻对手的大国竞争。”Naeem补充道，今天的辐射威胁已经超出了核武器的范围，包括“脏弹”、低剂量辐射和有毒金属污染。“脏弹是附着在被盗或孤立放射源上的传统爆炸装置，可将辐射分散到某个区域，”Naeem说。“如今，非国家行为者有可能在一个主要城市中心引爆其中一枚脏弹，我们需要做好应对准备。我们可以帮助确定何时可以安全进入该地区，以及如何处理现场人员。”为了应对当今的威胁，AFRRI专注于三个领域：研究、教育和安全，在研究方面，有五个主要重点领域：低剂量辐射、生物剂量学或辐射损伤诊断、辐射创伤复合损伤、有毒金属暴露和辐射对策。AFRRI的基础设施，包括其研究核反应堆和其他辐射设施，可以在数周到数月的时间内模拟核爆炸的即时辐射效应、核沉降物的辐射效应以及核爆炸后区域的长期辐射效应。“AFRRI是放射学研究的领导者，我们也有致力于全球教育和应急响应的团队，”AFRRI军事医疗行动（MMO）部门负责人陆军中校（博士）连森察克说。“我们目前正在进行的一些具体的实地研究集中在电磁脉冲对医疗设备、军服的热阻、免提辐射检测设备和寒冷天气下干洗去污测试材料的影响。”AFRRI在治疗药物的开发中至关重要，限制和治疗辐射损伤，以及高精度的生物剂量学工具，从新的分析到软件程序。AFRRI的研究人员，如Senchak和她的同事William F.Blakely博士，一位帮助开发多参数生物剂量学模型和辐射风险评估工具的资深科学家，AFRRI的科学家们正致力于通过与他们的MMO部门协同工作，将此类研究转化为教育和操作培训。Blakely说：“MMO作为AFRRI的运营和应用部门，将研究和专业知识应用于现实世界的问题。”。“生物剂量学小组与MMO合作，为评估辐射相关伤害准备了几份指导文件。最近，我们还参与创建了一个辐射风险沟通工具，这是一份一页的文件，用于帮助现场指挥官沟通在潜在辐射环境中操作的风险该系不仅为USU的学生和领导人，而且为全世界的学生和领导人提供这些教育和培训工具。Senchak说：“医学界和该领域的专业人士对辐射的了解非常有限。”。“对医疗领域的人们来说，对辐射暴露的早期症状进行教育是很重要的，这样他们就可以对患者进行分类。我们有一个遍布世界各地的团队，对医疗专业人员进行急性辐射损伤的健康影响、如何治疗辐射损伤以及如何检测辐射和其他有害物质的培训MMO还提供了快速部署的反应团队，这些团队已经处理了世界各地的各种情况，例如福岛核反应堆熔毁和2001年的炭疽病袭击，并随时准备应对出现的新威胁。国防部还协助北约和其他国际组织进行战备演习和编写教材。森查克、布莱克利和他们的同事为完成这一关键任务而感到自豪，并且非常喜欢在一个科学和现实世界解决方案之间有着如此明确联系的机构中进行研究。Blakely说：“作为一名在我的职业生涯中寻找工作的年轻科学家，我对AFRRI很感兴趣，因为它拥有关键资源，如来自各军种的人员、平民科学家、相关来源、剂量测定支持和尖端研究技术。”。“在过去的38年里，我在AFRRI工作，为提高医疗准备以应对潜在的放射性事件做出了贡献，这是一次非常美妙的经历。我强烈建议其他人加入我们，为我们的使命做出贡献，以保护美国军事人员的健康和表现，并通过研究保护人类。”h这有助于理解电离辐射的影响。”
359,NIWC Atlantic Advances New Technologies at NICE ANTX,"CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. C Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Atlantic wrapped up a joint civilian-military exercise on April 14 at Camp Lejeune, N.C., where over 60 emerging technologies were evaluated by the Navy and Marine Corps for future warfighter application. 

NIWC Atlantic partnered with Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) and Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory (MCWL) to spearhead the planning and execution of the 10-day Naval Integration in Contested Environments (NICE) Advanced Naval Technology Exercise (ANTX), one of the Navy’s largest participations in an ANTX to date.

“It was awesome to see the great collaboration occurring between our Marines and Sailors, large and small businesses, and our government warfare centers as they experimented together with new technologies and operating concepts to serve the warfighter in contested environments,” said the Honorable James Geurts, currently performing the duties of Under Secretary of the Navy. “Enabling our operators to provide candid and immediate feedback on these technologies ensures we leverage their valuable perspective and experiences as we together shape the equipment needed to compete and win in future contested environments.”

ANTXs demonstrate emerging technologies in operationally relevant settings. With the focus of NICE ANTX on naval integration, technology owners knew their products would be judged through the lens of naval warfare concepts like expeditionary advanced base operations (EABO) and distributed maritime operations (DMO).

Each prototype technology was grouped into one of six capability areas: command and control, communications, domain maneuver, fires and effects, fleet support, and operations in an information environment.

Naval leaders selected roughly 65 technologies, the majority of them from private industry. Assessors gauged each capability while observers envisioned relevant EABO/DMO scenarios in which each product could be used. 

Technologies focused on radio frequency waveforms, autonomous air and sea vehicles, advanced sensors, optical communications, cybersecurity applications, and a variety of software capabilities.

“The assessments helped us understand exactly how those technologies could work in an operational environment,” said Matt Largent, a NIWC Atlantic engineer and NICE ANTX assessment lead. “That information is also extremely useful to the technology owners, since some products can be improved upon to help us with capability gaps we are looking to fill.”

NIWC Atlantic brought along eight of its own technologies to demonstrate at NICE ANTX, including an airborne surrogate satellite capability designed to provide warfighters fallback communications.

ANTX exercises are one of several aggressive steps the Navy and Marine Corps are taking to establish cultures of experimentation, adaptation and risk-taking that will help increase speed and agility in technology development and procurement, according to Greg Hays, NIWC Atlantic’s senior scientific technology manager for Rapid Prototyping and Fleet Exercises. 

“We take pride in addressing these issues and in understanding the future impact that science and technology will have on warfare,” said Hays, also a participant in the exercise. “Integrating new technologies into the fleet faster than our adversaries will be a key to achieving tech overmatch and winning the information war. We get there by offering these very low-barrier-of-entry opportunities that come with accelerated contractual options, including the Commercial Solutions Opening.”

The nation’s most recent National Defense Strategy calls for “no complacency” in an increasingly complex global security environment that is marked by rapid technological change and challenges from adversaries in every operating domain. The document also states that new commercial technologies are changing society, which, ultimately, will change the character of war.

“It will take the entire team working together to maintain our competitive edge,” Geurts emphasized.

On April 9, Geurts toured the technology areas aboard Camp Lejeune, along with Lt. Gen. Eric Smith, U.S. Marine Corps deputy commandant for Combat Development and Integration, and Vice Adm. James Kilby, deputy Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) for Warfighting Requirements and Capabilities (OPNAV N9).

For the exercise, members of 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF) based at Camp Lejeune hosted the ANTX footprint and supported onsite logistics. Marines from II MEF, MCWL and other organizations comprised the contingent of 160 technology assessors, along with a record two dozen Sailors and roughly 60 DOD civilians. 

Uniformed assessors had backgrounds ranging from infantry and artillery to communications and navigation. An enlisted Marine from MCWL who participated in the exercise said ANTX is a win-win scenario for both the military and the private sector.

“It brings these technologies in front of us to not only see the realm of what’s possible,” said Staff Sgt. Joshua Crabb, “but also to offer our operational and technical expertise, to help make the products better, which serves both our needs as well as the company’s.”

Brig. Gen. Benjamin Watson, MCWL commanding general and NICE ANTX officer in charge, called the exercise a great opportunity to solve hard tactical and operational problems.

“A unique thing about ANTX is the warfighter integration,” Watson said during a visit to Camp Lejeune on April 14. “Rather than it just being a technology fair for innovators to show off their wares, ANTX enables our industry partners to insert their technologies into specific mission threads. It demonstrates not just capability, but relevance of that technology.” 

Dana Rushing, NIWC Atlantic execution lead for NICE ANTX, said the complex exercise with many moving parts and multiple major stakeholders and industries saw as many as 800 participants cycle through. 

“From inception to endpoint, this year’s ANTX was a major success,” Rushing said. “It was particularly rewarding to see NIWC Atlantic engineers and private tech companies collaborating throughout the process. That, coupled with direct feedback from the Navy and Marine Corps, makes events like this invaluable to the future of the warfighter.”

NICE ANTX took place in open fields and followed strict protocols to minimize COVID-19 exposure. Capt. Wesley Sanders, NIWC Atlantic commanding officer, said it felt good to get outdoors and see the fruits of his team’s labors.

“NICE ANTX was a huge lift, with many months of preparation, and monumental implications for the warfighter,” Sanders said. “I am just so proud of everyone on the team who helped make this year’s exercise a success.”

NIWC Atlantic Executive Director Peter C. Reddy echoed the commander’s remarks.

“I’m not just so proud of the NIWC Atlantic team,” Reddy said, “but excited for our engineers and scientists who are receiving this infusion of real-time feedback from uniformed Marines and Sailors. Incorporating the warfighter’s thoughts and perspectives on these technologies when they are back in the lab will make our work that much more purposeful and meaningful. It also means these capabilities could one day end up in the hands of our warfighters.”

360,"CCAD inducts new helicopter model, begins modification on new cockpit","CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas -- In keeping with current technological advancements, a Corpus Christi Army Depot Induction ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the newest upgrade to the UH-60 Black Hawk Helicopter, here, January 9, 2019.
	The U.S. Army has utilized the Black Hawk since the 1970s. They are offered in multiple airframe configurations, including the Alpha, Lima, Mike and Victor models, all used to provide air assault, general support, aeromedical evacuation, command and control, and special operations support to combat, stability and support operations.
	Induction C beginning the modernization process C of the Lima-model helicopters is twofold: To introduce an affordable and relevant technological upgrade and improve the aviation community’s requirements for such a helicopter, said Jackie Allen, industrial engineer, CCAD.
	CCAD will begin the nine-step recapitalization process on a Black Hawk immediately following the ceremony, with six more to follow this fiscal year, said Allen. The final end state scheduled for CCAD is 760 converted Victor-model Black Hawks. 
Specifics to the modification are focused on the cockpit and the electronic components within, said Don Dawson, director of aircraft production, CCAD. 
“(Lima models) have an old analog dial instrumentation,” said Dawson. “What this (upgrade) does is gives (the Victor model) a full glass cockpit,” which is similar to the Mike model. 
	A glass cockpit is a digital suite that streamlines an enhanced management system allowing for better Pilot-Vehicle Interface or PVI, added Allen.
	Many advantages to a better PVI, includes using a moving map, enhanced messaging between the pilots and commands, and the best navigation system available, which is part of an open system architecture, said Lt. Col. Andrew Duus, product manager, Program Executive Office, Aviation, Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. 
	“The open system architecture will significantly minimize the time getting new technology uploaded into the aircraft,” said Duus.
The upgrade goes further than an infrastructure to improving pilot interaction and training efforts.
	Dawson said, the upgrade will “help the pilots with all the information flow coming to them… it synergizes the information and gives it to them in bite-size pieces.”
	Additionally, the upgrade will help in the training of pilots as most are learning on Mike models that are already equipped with the digital cockpit.
	“(The upgrade) will speed up the cost of training for new pilots, because they now can learn, essentially, one cockpit instead of two,” added Dawson. 
	CCAD is prepared for this project, which is considered a “significant responsibility” given the depot’s position to produce such a “phenomenal helicopter for our (Army),” said Col. Gail Atkins, commander, CCAD.
	Duus said he and PEO leadership is thankful for CCAD’s commitment to this project and are confident in the work they perform.
	“The legacy and trust that has been established by (CCAD) is what has got us here… I look forward to working with all of you and harness the value you provide, thank you again,” said Duus.",2019/1/22,https://www.dvidshub.net/news/307761/ccad-inducts-new-helicopter-model-begins-modification-new-cockpit,"CORPUS CHRISTI, TX, UNITED STATES",[],[],科珀斯克里斯蒂，德克萨斯州，美国,CCAD引进新直升机型号，开始对新座舱进行改造,科珀斯克里斯蒂，得克萨斯州――为了配合当前的技术进步，科珀斯克里斯蒂陆军基地入职仪式于2019年1月9日在这里举行，以标志UH-60黑鹰直升机最新升级的开始。美国陆军自20世纪70年代以来一直使用黑鹰直升机。它们以多种机身配置提供，包括阿尔法、利马、迈克和维克托机型，所有这些机型都用于提供空中突击、一般支援、航空医疗后送、指挥和控制以及作战的特别行动支援，稳定和支持运行。工业工程师Jackie Allen说，利马型号直升机的入职培训――现代化进程的开始――有两个方面：引进负担得起的相关技术升级，提高航空界对此类直升机的要求，艾伦说，CCAD将在仪式结束后立即开始黑鹰式的九步资本重组过程，本财年还将有六步。CCAD计划的最终状态为760辆改装的维克多型号黑鹰。CCAD飞机生产总监唐・道森（Don Dawson）表示，改装的细节主要集中在驾驶舱和驾驶舱内的电子部件上。“利马型号）有一个旧的模拟拨号仪器，”道森说。“这（升级）所做的是给（维克托模型）一个全玻璃驾驶舱，”这与迈克模型类似。Allen补充道，玻璃驾驶舱是一个数字套件，它简化了增强的管理系统，允许更好的人机界面或PVI。更好的PVI有许多优点，包括使用移动地图，增强飞行员和指挥之间的信息传递，以及可用的最佳导航系统，这是开放系统架构的一部分，阿拉巴马州红石兵工厂航空项目执行办公室产品经理安德鲁・杜斯中校说。“开放式系统架构将大大减少将新技术上传到飞机上的时间，”Duus说。升级不仅仅是一个基础设施，还将进一步改善飞行员互动和培训工作。Dawson说，升级将“帮助飞行员获得所有的信息流……它将信息协同起来，并以微小的碎片形式提供给他们。”此外，升级将有助于飞行员的培训，因为大多数飞行员都在学习已经装备了数字驾驶舱的麦克型号。”（升级）这将加快新飞行员的培训成本，因为他们现在基本上可以学习一个驾驶舱而不是两个，”道森补充道。CCAD为这个项目做好了准备，考虑到基地生产这种“为我们（军队）制造的非凡直升机”的地位，这被认为是一项“重大责任”杜斯说，他和PEO领导层感谢CCAD对该项目的承诺，并对他们所做的工作充满信心。“CCAD所建立的遗产和信任使我们走到了这里……我期待着与你们所有人合作，利用你们提供的价值，再次感谢你们。”杜斯说。
361,CCDC’s Road Map to Modernizing the Army- Soldier lethality,"Sixth in a series of articles on how the Combat Capabilities Development Command is supporting the Army’s “six plus two” modernization priorities. 

by Maj. Gen. John A. George

Maj. Gen. John A. George assumed command of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command on Nov. 1, 2019. He continues this series of articles on the Army’s modernization priorities.

Today’s Soldiers require advanced capabilities to be effective on future battlefields. Advances in technology have produced better weapon optics, imaging devices and body armor, as well as many other types of specialized protective and offensive gear. Body armor that could protect Soldiers against rifle fire, for example, was not available during World War II, the Korean War or Operation Desert Storm. Today’s Soldiers have body armor that includes front, rear and side ballistic plates to protect them against small-arms fire, as well as flexible groin and collar panels that provide protection against shrapnel and debris. While the body armor provides an added lifesaving layer of protection for Soldiers, it weighs 30 pounds. 

On average, a Soldier carries at least 60 pounds of gear, but that weight often doubles depending on the length of the mission and the Soldier’s job. A 72-hour mission in Afghanistan, for example, requires an Airborne Soldier to carry seven types of batteries that collectively weigh 16 pounds to power optics, flashlights, night vision devices, GPS and a radio. In addition to the base uniform, a Soldier wears protective gloves, boots and glasses, as well as body armor and a helmet. 

Reducing the amount of weight Soldiers wear and carry, while also keeping them safe, is critical to the Army. As part of the future force modernization enterprise, the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command (CCDC) supports this mission, which is key to the Soldier lethality modernization priority as well as other efforts to ensure that Soldiers can survive and operate in any environment. While the CCDC Soldier Center leads the Soldier lethality modernization effort for the command, other CCDC centers, including Aviation and Missile; Data and Analysis; Armaments; and Command, Control, Computers, Communications, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C5ISR), round out the team.

CCDC relies heavily on academia, industry and international partners to develop and demonstrate new technologies that will increase protection, lethality, agility and mission flexibility. The command works closely with small businesses by communicating its strategic direction in support of the Soldier lethality modernization priority and investing in emerging commercial technologies. CCDC also works closely with the cross-functional teams on research and innovation projects that support the Army’s modernization priorities. These collaborations drive innovation and strengthen the Soldiers’ performance, increasing readiness to meet the Army’s critical thresholds―a force capable of multidomain operations by 2028 and 2035.

CCDC is developing technologies that support Soldier lethality, including a host of capabilities that enable a Soldier to shoot, move, communicate, protect, sustain and train. In treating the Soldier as a weapon system, each technology must work with the others to enable the Soldier to perform tasks and reach a destination faster and with greater lethality and efficiency. To avoid the historical norm of adding each new piece of equipment to the Soldier’s gear and increasing weight, we are leveraging multifunctional materials and capability integration in our portfolio planning. 

FUELING SOLDIERS

Food is the “fuel” of the Soldier weapon system. Just as reducing the weight of a vehicle can increase its fuel economy, we are increasing the nutritional density of the food Soldiers eat, and that high-octane fuel will increase the Soldiers’ lethality. The CCDC Soldier Center Combat Feeding Directorate is developing the Close Combat Assault Ration, a lightweight ration that’s energy- and nutrient-dense and designed to sustain small units in remote sites up to seven days without resupply. The logistical footprint of the Close Combat Assault Ration is compatible with the service’s autonomous aerial and ground delivery of food and supplies for expeditionary operations.

The Soldier Center uses emerging food processing technologies, including vacuum microwave drying and ultrasonic agglomeration, to reduce the weight and volume of military rations. Vacuum microwave drying uniformly removes water with both vacuum and microwave techniques, and can result in physically compressed food that remains moist. Ultrasonic agglomeration uses vibration to instantly compress food without fillers or binders, reducing the meal by 30 to 50 percent of its original size with the same ingredients and nutrition. The Soldier Center targets a reduction in weight for a seven-day supply of food from 18 to 12 pounds. It plans to deliver final specifications for the Close Combat Assault Ration by 2022.

As part of the combat rations development process, our researchers worked with Soldiers and Marines in the 10th Special Forces Group, Fort Carson, Colorado; 2nd Reconnaissance Battalion, 2nd Marine Division, Camp Lejeune, North Carolina; and the 3rd Squadron, 71st Cavalry Regiment, 10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum, New York, to gather feedback to refine technical and operational information, evaluate prototypes and determine trade-off analysis.  

We rely heavily on input from Soldier touch points, training and testing events where Soldiers test technology and provide feedback. One touch point that we use on a continuous basis is the Human Research Volunteer Program, located at the CCDC Soldier Center in Natick, Massachusetts. The Soldier Center recruits 30 to 40 Soldiers for approximately 120 days to serve as a baseline model for human research and provide user feedback on tests, studies and evaluations. 

A cadre of experienced Soldiers, including a company commander, first sergeant and several noncommissioned officers in the infantry military occupational specialty, are part of the program. These Soldiers provide valuable insight and serve as in-house tactical experts for science and technology research at the Soldier Center. The program recently completed several rounds of data collection with Soldiers that will be used to transition the next generation of combat boots.

POWERING UP WITH STRONGER BATTERIES

As the Army modernizes the current force and prepares for multidomain operations, the quantity and capabilities of Soldier-worn technologies are expected to increase significantly, and Soldiers will need more power and energy sources to operate them. CCDC’s Soldier Center and the C5ISR Center are increasing Soldier lethality and survivability by researching and developing batteries that are lighter and have more power and extended runtimes.

Researchers at the C5ISR Center are exploring improvements in silicon-anode technologies to support lightweight batteries, including the Conformal Wearable Battery, a thin, flexible, lightweight battery that can be worn on a Soldier’s vest to power electronics. Silicon-anode technologies can double the performance and duration of currently fielded batteries for dismounted Soldiers. Early prototypes of the updated silicon-anode battery delivered the same amount of energy with a 29 percent reduction in volume and weight.

Our researchers are integrating the silicon-anode battery with the Army’s Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), a high-priority battlefield heads-up display that uses augmented reality to help Soldiers train. The C5ISR Center plans to use 200 silicon-anode battery prototypes during an IVAS Soldier touch point exercise in July 2020, which will be the first operational demonstration to showcase the battery.

The C5ISR Center is developing a centralized power source for small-arms weapons for the Army’s Next Generation Squad Weapon program. The new weapon will have increased capabilities and as a result will require more power than the current baseline system. A power and data rail will enable Soldiers to power any weapon-mounted device, similar to a cellphone charging pad. Electricity will run along the rail and enable power to go to standardized contacts, eliminating the need for Soldiers to manage or carry multiple power sources. Currently, separate batteries are required for each device, including scopes, range finders and thermal sights; with a power and data rail, Soldiers will not have to manage battery swaps since one battery will provide the necessary power for any device.

DELIVERING SOLDIER LETHALITY

The CCDC Armaments Center is the center for lethality in munitions, systems to deliver the munitions and fire control. The center’s main projects are aimed at increasing Soldier lethality by reducing load and decision-making while increasing capability in a multidomain environment. Together, these projects prove what is within the realm of possible in science and technology for Soldier overmatch on the battlefield.

The Next Generation Squad Weapon project consolidates ammunition and weapons as well as a power and data rail for integration of next-generation fire control systems. The overall system, which was designed to show advanced technologies and serve as a replacement for the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon, provides a lightweight cased and telescoped cartridge with greater lethality than the current, fielded squad automatic weapons and at a much lighter weight than the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon. The 6.8 mm bullet, designed in-house, provides greater lethality and range than the Army’s current 5.56 mm bullets. This technology was transitioned to the Project Manager (PM) for Soldier Lethality (formerly the Project Manager for Soldier Weapons) within the Program Executive Office for Soldier in fiscal year 2019. 

The Armaments Center will continue to design follow-on bullet types in direct support of Soldier operations in its Next Generation Family of Ammunition project, which has multiple technology transitions through fiscal year 2023.

The Squad Combat Optic Performance Enhancement science and technology project is the Armaments Center’s solution for a next-generation primary optic and fire control, similar in capability to a targeting system on a combat vehicle but at a fraction of the size. The system consists of a direct-view optic with an augmented reality overlay, a steerable laser range finder, a daylight and thermal digital weapons camera, and a controller designed to reduce aim error and increase probability of hit. The Armaments Center will use data collected from various Soldier touch points to influence follow-on designs with industry. This technology is slated to transfer to PM Soldier Lethality in mid-fiscal year 2020.

ROBOTICS AND AI FOR SOLDIER PROTECTION

The Soldier Center’s Protection and Survivability Directorate is developing directed energy protective ensembles, head-borne integration platforms and concealment. Together, these will enable Soldiers to operate and dominate in any climate or location by remaining undetected from enemy eyes and sensors, and provide protection from battlefield threats if engaged. Directed energy, which is microwave energy, is an emerging battlefield threat that may be used for anti-access and area denial. Head-borne integration will bring together the protection, sensors and information displays that Soldiers need for multidomain operations into a helmet-based system that will reduce weight and complexity while enabling enhanced lethality.

At the dismounted squad level, CCDC Soldier Center is looking at robotics and autonomous systems to increase situational awareness during combat operations. Small unmanned aerial systems, such as the Soldier Borne Sensor or Short Range Reconnaissance platforms, will provide dismounted squads and platoons remote reconnaissance for improved standoff protection and improved situational understanding of the environment.

KEEPING IT VIRTUAL

Early synthetic prototyping uses virtual modeling and simulation to test best ideas and concepts from Soldiers and industry for rapid capability development and force modernization. Early synthetic prototyping uses a government-owned software platform: a virtual sandbox developed by the Systems Simulation, Software and Integration Directorate’s Army Game Studio, within CCDC’s Aviation and Missile Center, that leverages modular commercial game technology; Army-owned assets, such as 3D models, sounds and sound effects; and other features to create and test concepts in a virtual operational environment and thereby produce data-driven capability requirements. 

Early synthetic prototyping experiments allow Soldiers to virtually conduct mission rehearsals using future equipment, doctrine and force structure in a simulated future operational environment against a future enemy. During a squad (up to future company) exercise, Soldiers control simulated systems and use the same operational decision-making they would use on tactical equipment and combat platforms, including mobility, fires, sensors, communications, obscurants and electronic warfare.

The Ground Vehicle Soldier Center Design Studio held a four-day virtual experiment demonstration using early synthetic prototyping in September. Thirty Soldiers from 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division participated in the demonstration and provided feedback on the Robotic Combat Vehicle’s crew configuration, formations, vehicle capabilities, enabling technologies and networked capabilities. During testing, Soldiers used the Robotic Combat Vehicle as a mobile shield in urban terrain and noted that they preferred the higher level of protection from the heavier robotic combat vehicle over the maneuverability of its lighter counterpart. These types of events will continue throughout fiscal year 2020, with each virtual experiment increasing in capability and fidelity. 

The Measuring and Advancing Soldier Tactical Readiness and Effectiveness program, which is led by the Soldier Center, will enable the Army to objectively and holistically measure Soldier and squad performance. The program, a collaborative effort with experts in human science research, sensor development, and data acquisition and analysis, will monitor, predict and enhance performance in close combat.

ANALYZING TECHNOLOGY FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE

As the Army’s largest in-house analytical capability, the CCDC Data and Analysis Center supports the Soldier lethality modernization priority by providing lethality analysis, modeling and simulation, cyber and electronic warfare, and vulnerability and weapon prototype testing for the Next Generation Squad Weapon. The Data and Analysis Center also performs electronic warfare and electronic-optical, electronic-infrared vulnerability analysis and assessment for IVAS and the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binoculars.

Cybersecurity analysts at the Data and Analysis Center work alongside Microsoft experts to set up a development environment suitable for the robust operations of IVAS, which is planned for fielding in fiscal year 2021. CCDC also provides modeling and simulation tools to predict and assess degradation of Soldier performance because of battlefield injuries.

The Data and Analysis Center is also working on the Soldier and squad trade space analysis framework (SSTAF), an architecture for evaluating the positive and negative effects of Soldier equipment on individual Soldier performance. The framework, which treats the Soldier as a unified system, will integrate several human performance models and simulations into one system. This will allow the Army to gather the necessary data to perform trade analysis for Soldier equipment and help inform Army leadership on acquisition decisions. A trade analysis compares different options, such as cost, effectiveness, weight, power, lethality and survivability, and then uses the information to make recommendations to senior leaders so they can make informed decisions. The first SSTAF prototype was completed at the end of fiscal year 2019, with additional capabilities to be added in 2020. It will provide timely, affordable trade analysis at the squad level for Army leaders who make investment decisions.

CONCLUSION

CCDC works with academia, industry and international partners to improve Soldier lethality modernization efforts. The Soldier Center partners with the University of Massachusetts Lowell, Tufts University, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Worcester Polytechnic Institute on various projects. We steer research to relevant military technologies through our membership with the Center for Advanced Research in Drying, which includes academic and industry partners.

We also participate in and lead communities of practice with partners in Army science and technology, industry and academia. Since 2010, CCDC Soldier Center’s Soldier Protection and Survivability Directorate has used the community of practice model successfully for individual ballistic and blast protection projects. The teams meet regularly to set research goals and monitor progress. The directorate recently added two communities of practice―one for Soldier camouflage and concealment and one for Soldier hydration and protection from environmental conditions.

We also work closely with small businesses by investing in emerging technologies and reaching out to military industrial bases to ensure that the technologies can be produced to supply military rations. Typically, more than 20 percent of the Army’s contracting budget is awarded to small businesses.

Keeping Soldiers safe without increasing the weight they wear or carry is an ongoing challenge for the Army. CCDC works closely with academia, industry and international partners to discover and develop the best technology to support this mission. Using information gathered from continuous experimentation and Soldier touch points, CCDC refines technology and focuses on research and engineering projects that will make Soldiers more lethal and increase combat readiness.
