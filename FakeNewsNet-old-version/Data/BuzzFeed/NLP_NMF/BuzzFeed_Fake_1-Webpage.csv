http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GettyImages-605695152.jpg,"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: 鈥楴atural鈥?For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here鈥檚 Google:

Naturally, my reaction was 鈥渙h, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife鈥檚 campaign now?鈥?
Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don鈥檛 do, to find out the real story 鈥?and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

鈥淚t was natural for people who鈥檝e been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn鈥檛 do anything they shouldn鈥檛 do,鈥?Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn鈥檛 mean they鈥檒l get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there鈥檚 no evidence they got them.

Now, let鈥檚 talk about the foundation the media doesn鈥檛 like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn鈥檛 given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump鈥檚 charitable foundation over concerns that it 鈥渆ngaged in some impropriety鈥?as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others鈥?contributions 鈥渢o make them appear to have come from him鈥?although he 鈥渉asn鈥檛 given to the foundation since 2008.鈥?Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton鈥檚 candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the 鈥渄ouble standard鈥?in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton鈥檚 pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post鈥檚 reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump鈥檚 Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton 鈥渟candal鈥?(if you call getting sick a 鈥渟candal鈥? while ignoring every scandal in Trump鈥檚 closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Obama-ISIS-Fox.jpg,"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an 鈥業slamic State鈥?in Iraq and Syria.鈥?
Obviously Obama鈥檚 dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a 鈥淛V鈥?team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn鈥檛 in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

First of all, there is evidence the birth certificate presented was altered. This is discounted by the claims that whoever presented this must be racist.

That would have chafed the media badly enough.

But the audience had something ELSE in common. Complaints against the Clintons, who 鈥?to hear these people tell it 鈥?once they got their money, were never seen again.

It turns out, they鈥檙e not very popular for their handling of Haiti.

Does any of this sound familiar? Lots of the money sent to 鈥楬elp鈥?Haiti didn鈥檛 ever reach the poor people.

They claim it found its way back to Washington Lobbyists. And then to the White House.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there 鈥榳orth reporting鈥欌€?nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

The camera followed them out of the room, scurrying like the rats they are.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to 鈥渟elective enforcement鈥?based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with 鈥渂aseless鈥?tickets, and that locals said: 鈥淢uslims don鈥檛 belong here.鈥?Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/charity.jpg,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation 鈥?where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners 鈥?the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed 鈥済ood鈥?that the foundation has done over the years.

I don鈥檛 think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they鈥檙e an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation鈥檚 massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization鈥檚 IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and 鈥渙ther expenses.鈥?The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization鈥檚 IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as 鈥渙ther expenses,鈥?while the remaining almost $851K was marked as 鈥減rofessional fundraising expenses.鈥?Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more 鈥渙ther expenses鈥?in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn鈥檛 impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it鈥檚 time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is 鈥渢hrilled鈥?to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago鈥檚 South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for 鈥渨hite privilege,鈥?huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags鈥?decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let鈥檚 see; wrecking the environment for the black man鈥檚 library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

What if that person is 鈥?Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled 鈥溾€淜enyan-born Obama all set for US Senate鈥?That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It鈥檚 still out there on the internet. Here鈥檚 a screen capture:

Here鈥檚 the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That鈥檚 not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama鈥檚 publicist. Here鈥檚 the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama鈥檚 then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as 鈥渂orn in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.鈥?The booklet, which was distributed to 鈥渂usiness colleagues鈥?in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama鈥檚 anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White鈥搘hich Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid 鈥?as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the 鈥榝oreigner鈥?card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of 鈥?whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN鈥橳 a lie鈥?then something else MUST be. That 鈥榮omething else鈥?being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The quote can be read in context at Breitbart.","['Rich Witmer', 'Doug Giles']",[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'og': {'site_name': 'Clash Daily', 'description': ""Well THAT'S Weird.

http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/aids.jpg,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed 鈥渨atered-down鈥?HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and 鈥渓ikely increased鈥?the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,鈥淭he Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,鈥?was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation鈥檚 most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton鈥檚 decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

鈥淭his is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation鈥檚 largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,鈥?said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

鈥淲hen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA鈥檚 approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,鈥?said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, 鈥渁lleged due to the company鈥檚 diluted drugs, it 鈥榮ubjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,鈥欌€?according to the report.

鈥淭he question becomes, 鈥榟ow many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,鈥欌€?asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton鈥檚 campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama鈥檚 first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation鈥檚 vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the 鈥渨atered-down鈥?drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered 鈥渕ore than $1.8 million packages.鈥?
鈥淪ubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,鈥?Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company鈥檚 anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

鈥淭hese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,鈥?he said.

Ranbaxy鈥檚 first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public 鈥渨arning letter鈥?to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company鈥檚 quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, 鈥渟how much lower potencies in these batches.鈥?
Although Ranbaxy鈥檚 generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company鈥檚 HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he鈥檚 now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on 鈥渁ccess鈥?to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. 鈥淚 have tried to reach out to them,鈥?he told TheDCNF. 鈥淏ut I haven鈥檛 had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.鈥?
CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was 鈥渄eeply suspect.鈥?
鈥淚n the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called 鈥楥HAI鈥?was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,鈥?Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, 鈥渞elaxed intellectual property policy standards,鈥?promising the U.S. government 鈥渨ould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any 鈥楽ub-Saharan country鈥?relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,鈥?the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI鈥檚 endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President鈥檚 Emergency Plan for AIDS relief 鈥?a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton鈥檚 endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become 鈥済ood acquisition targets,鈥?according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they 鈥渆xploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,鈥?the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration.jpg,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter鈥檚 apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton鈥檚 apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary鈥檚 stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Untitled-1-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-Recovered-4.jpg,"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He鈥檚 suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned 鈥渞apists鈥?and 鈥渄rug dealers鈥?from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a 鈥渢emporary measure.鈥?He鈥檚 even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

鈥淭he other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don鈥檛 kid yourself. When they say they don鈥檛 care about their lives, you have to take out their families.鈥?
But he鈥檚 not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald鈥檚 Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism 鈥?he鈥檚 fighting the 鈥渘arratives鈥?of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump鈥檚 鈥渘arrative鈥?is 鈥渒ill them all鈥?

Last weekend鈥檚 attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama鈥檚 watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we鈥檙e in more than a fight about 鈥榥arratives鈥?鈥?these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: 鈥淭hey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.鈥?
Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is 鈥渞adical Islamic terrorism,鈥?and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating 鈥渢errorists?鈥?
鈥淭hey鈥檙e protecting each other, but they鈥檙e really doing very bad damage 鈥?they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,鈥?Trump said in March. 鈥淲hen they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that鈥檚 a big problem.鈥?
If Muslims are 鈥減rotecting鈥?terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump鈥檚 eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists鈥?families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself 鈥?but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents鈥?security to 鈥渟ee what happens鈥?to them (shortly after suggesting that 鈥淪econd Amendment People鈥?could deal with them. We鈥檙e dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the 鈥榣ittle red button鈥?that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It鈥檚 also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen 鈥?one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He鈥檚 said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation 鈥?to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it鈥檚 the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg,"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to 鈥渢rue democracy.鈥?If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

鈥楥ollision of cultures鈥?
In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led 鈥渢o a collision of cultures鈥?but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

鈥淚 believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,鈥?Obama said. 鈥淚n order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.鈥?
The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and 鈥渢he enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.鈥?Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought鈥?.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'og': {'site_name': 'Allen West Republic', 'description': 'God help us', 'title': 'Obama Pushes One World Government', 'locale': 'en_US', 'image': {'width': 648, 'identifier': 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg', 'height': 351}, 'url': 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/', 'type': 'article'}, 'robots': 'noimageindex', 'fb': {'app_id': 444516555706636}, 'article': {'section': 'Barack Hussein Obama', 'tag': 'United Nations', 'published_time': '2016-09-20T21:05:31-04:00', 'author': 'https://www.facebook.com/AllenWestRepublic'}, 'viewport': 'initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no'}",http://allenwestrepublic.com/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,"['http://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/615163699414745088/hUr8iaHP_normal.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18929-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-52ePUfP6_NxQ_.gif', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18919-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama-1120x588.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18943-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18952-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18957-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18958-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18926-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=22315475&cv=2.0&cj=1', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18939-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18925-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18938-featured-300x130.png', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18935-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/allenwestrepublic_site_logo-2.png', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/wordpress-popular-posts/18914-featured-300x130.jpg', 'http://allenwestrepublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/1984obama.jpg']",Obama Pushes One World Government,http://allenwestrepublic.com/2016/09/20/obama-pushes-one-world-government/,,[],{'$date': 1474329600000},http://allenwestrepublic.com
http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/charity.jpg,"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation 鈥?where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners 鈥?the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed 鈥済ood鈥?that the foundation has done over the years.

I don鈥檛 think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they鈥檙e an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation鈥檚 massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization鈥檚 IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and 鈥渙ther expenses.鈥?The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization鈥檚 IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as 鈥渙ther expenses,鈥?while the remaining almost $851K was marked as 鈥減rofessional fundraising expenses.鈥?Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more 鈥渙ther expenses鈥?in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hillary-clinton-1.jpg,"I can鈥檛 wait for 鈥淲eekend at Chelsea鈥檚鈥?to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton鈥檚 slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups 鈥?these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low 鈥?would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a 鈥渕inor setback鈥?to her 鈥渋nevitable鈥?victory.

The American people aren鈥檛 buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more 鈥渃onspiracy theory鈥?dismissals. Mrs. Clinton鈥檚 鈥渕ild cold,鈥?er, 鈥渟easonal allergies,鈥?I mean 鈥渉eat exhaustion,鈥?that is to say 鈥渕inor case of pneumonia鈥?is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a 鈥渕ystery man鈥?who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable 鈥渆pisodes鈥?(or otherwise freezes up with a brain 鈥渟hort-circuit鈥?during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson鈥檚 disease 鈥?a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has 鈥減neumonia鈥?required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won鈥檛, but they should. I wonder what official 鈥渄iagnosis鈥?we鈥檒l get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they鈥檝e been there a hundred times before. 鈥淣othing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton鈥檚 sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she 鈥榩owered through鈥?yesterday going door-to-door.鈥?
The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She鈥檚 proven, yet again, that she can鈥檛 be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She鈥檚 a liar. That鈥檚 her default mode. She鈥檚 corrupt. And she鈥檚 sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else 鈥?including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton鈥檚 sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. 鈥淒o not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice鈥?(Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump鈥檚 supporters as a 鈥渞acist鈥?and 鈥渋rredeemable鈥?鈥渂asket of deplorables,鈥?has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement 鈥?especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her 鈥渇riend and mentor.鈥?Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags 鈥?the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who鈥檚 the racist?

I鈥檓 praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can鈥檛 help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It鈥檚 almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she鈥檚 ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she鈥檚 put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, 鈥淢any are the plans in a person鈥檚 heart, but it is the LORD鈥檚 purpose that prevails.鈥?
Am I saying there鈥檚 no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there鈥檚 always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton鈥檚 political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector 鈥?a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/barack_obama_crying.jpg,"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there鈥檚 no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/administration.jpg,"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter鈥檚 apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton鈥檚 apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary鈥檚 stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

However it鈥檚 was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton鈥檚 schedule.

Interesting fact鈥?I just searched Hillary Clinton鈥檚 rally events scheduled between September 20 鈥?October 19 鈥?She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn鈥檛 list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I鈥檓 no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton鈥檚 left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn鈥檛 appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton鈥檚 health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won鈥檛 be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the 鈥渃onspirators.鈥?
Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

There鈥檚 a lot that could be discussed about last night鈥檚 debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that鈥檚 not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many鈥? Hillary didn鈥檛 appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear鈥s that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer鈥o you see it?

It certainly wouldn鈥檛 be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a 鈥淐ough prevention machine鈥?in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton鈥檚 campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

While we aren鈥檛 sure what was going on inside Hillary鈥檚 little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, 鈥淒id u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?鈥?
Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter鈥︹€淪he can鈥檛 even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.鈥?
Then Woods added:

鈥淪he literally can鈥檛 help herself. She鈥檚 the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.鈥?
Of course, we don鈥檛 have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

We鈥檝e all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably 鈥渞ead my lips鈥o new taxes,鈥?a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend鈥檚 Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO 鈥?Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn鈥檛 promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let鈥檚 imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. 鈥淒estroy鈥?doesn鈥檛 leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty 鈥測eeeeehaw,鈥?the reality is that he鈥檚 talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He鈥檚 talking about profiling Muslims. He鈥檚 talking about Donald Trump鈥檚 version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn鈥檛 just a Muslim, he鈥檚 an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn鈥檛 just a Muslim, he鈥檚 an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he鈥檚 a suspect in a bombing doesn鈥檛 mean he鈥檚 guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked 鈥渒ill鈥?and not on the most wanted list. There鈥檚 nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump鈥檚 dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I鈥檓 being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn鈥檛 about the narrative. It isn鈥檛 about prevention or education.

It鈥檚 about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he鈥檚 promising is nothing but another 鈥渞ead my lips.鈥?Terrorism isn鈥檛 something you can simply 鈥渄estroy鈥?just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn鈥檛 going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump鈥檚 campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

Ray Odierno believes we鈥檝e reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; 鈥淭he Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president鈥檚 astounding incompetence, there鈥檚 also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component. Investment in modernization is down by 25%, Odierno said, sidelining ""much-needed"" infantry fighting vehicle modernization and a scout helicopter development program.",['Bob Amoroso'],[],"{'generator': 'WordPress 4.8.1', 'og': {'site_name': 'US Herald', 'description': 'With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army 鈥?, 'title': 'Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence 鈰?US Herald', 'locale': 'en_US', 'image': {'width': 640, 'identifier': 'http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_1428850208.jpg', 'height': 360}, 'updated_time': '2015-11-09T14:07:15-05:00', 'url': 'http://usherald.com/top-army-chief-of-staff-general-has-had-it-with-obama-incompetence/', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'description': 'With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army [鈥', 'creator': '@usheraldnews', 'image': 'http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_1428850208.jpg', 'title': 'Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence 鈰?US Herald', 'site': '@usheraldnews', 'card': 'summary_large_image'}, 'fb': {'app_id': 211561922608080, 'pages': 1746057572287188}, 'article': {'publisher': 'https://www.facebook.com/unitedstatesherald/', 'section': 'US NEWS', 'published_time': '2015-04-22T10:10:33-05:00', 'modified_time': '2015-11-09T14:07:15-05:00'}, 'google-site-verification': 'ZdE3006b76rd8x4CyNxQi3cdpRirnUjvfut4ZYX-bqY', 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'}",http://usherald.com/top-army-chief-of-staff-general-has-had-it-with-obama-incompetence/,"['http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/usherald-logo.png', 'http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_14288502081.jpg', 'https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=718459264928386&ev=PixelInitialized', 'http://usherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post_1428850208.jpg']",Top Army Chief of Staff General Has Had It With Obama Incompetence 鈰?US Herald,http://usherald.com/top-army-chief-of-staff-general-has-had-it-with-obama-incompetence?utm_source=aep&utm_medium=generalobamaincompetent&utm_campaign=fbext,,[],{'$date': 1429715433000},http://usherald.com

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don鈥檛 like.

http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/steal.jpg,"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a 鈥減owerful hate group,鈥?has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America鈥檚 Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author鈥檚 contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get 鈥淗illary the Horrible鈥?into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone 鈥?especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President 鈥?to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters 鈥?but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens 鈥?to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America鈥檚 most powerful 鈥淗ate Group,鈥?not only wants 鈥淗illary the Horrible鈥?to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

http://eaglerising.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/hillary-6.jpg,"A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson 鈥渁pproved鈥?that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly 鈥渨ar mongering鈥?opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson鈥檚 deceitful war policies, Goldwater鈥檚 vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation鈥檚 media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a 鈥淒aisy鈥?remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater鈥檚 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today鈥檚 voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as 鈥渘ews and views.鈥?With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media鈥檚 reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted鈥檚 鈥渄ramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.鈥?This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a 鈥減athological liar鈥?and 鈥渦tterly amoral.鈥?
As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of 鈥溾€橪yin Ted,鈥?insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.鈥?These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say 鈥渄erogatory鈥?when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the 鈥渓iberal press鈥?moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public鈥檚 re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and r茅sum茅s of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President鈥檚 past considerations of today鈥檚 democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, 鈥淪he will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can鈥檛 be trusted and isn鈥檛 qualified to be President.鈥?
Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it鈥檚 damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: 鈥淚f you can鈥檛 run your own house, you certainly can鈥檛 run the White House.鈥?
Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn鈥檛 it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

There鈥檚 a lot to be discussed about last night鈥檚 debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn鈥檛 cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

I think we all know why #TrumpWon pic.twitter.com/nwZRxvkX81 鈥?USA For Trump 2016 (@USAforTrump2016) September 27, 2016

This wouldn鈥檛 be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a 鈥淐ough prevention machine鈥?in her pantsuit?

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC鈥檚 Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to 鈥渇act-check鈥?him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News鈥?Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn鈥檛 all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in 鈥?he had his reservations.

鈥淵ou know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn鈥檛 talk. I mean we have to, you know, it鈥檚 sort of like either do it or don鈥檛 do it,鈥?Trump said.

鈥淲ell, he鈥檚 (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn鈥檛 be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he鈥檚 under a lot of pressure,鈥?said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged 鈥渟upport鈥?for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn鈥檛 surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump鈥檚 name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

Why in the hell do we still support Saudi Arabia? We don鈥檛 need their oil鈥?we would make do. The majority of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, as does the Bin Laden family. The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton鈥檚 campaign. She鈥檚 taking money from a stone cold enemy and that鈥檚 not the only one by any means. You do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country鈥?period. That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we?

Now it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold鈥?whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?

From Jihad Watch:

It isn鈥檛 news that the Islamic State has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves 鈥?especially Yazidi girls 鈥?but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of IS are being 鈥渟old in horrifying auctions to UK ally Saudi Arabia.鈥?An eyewitness reported: 脳 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Dozens of women were being held in a large room, and it was not only Iraqis and Syrians trading women but also Saudis and Westerners, whose actual nationality was not clear. Western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the Islamic State鈥檚 practice of enslaving kafir women: The Islamic State鈥檚 human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be 鈥榢afir鈥? non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin.

As these women are 鈥榬escued鈥?from ISIS, they are not being given freedom. They are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. These are the people that Hillary Clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. Monsters of a feather.

I have said for a long time, not only are the Saudis sponsoring ISIS, so are the Russians. We are being played. Our own president is complicit. Let鈥檚 not elect another corrupt demon who cares nothing of women and children being sold to rapists. After all, Hillary Clinton is married to one.",['Terresa Monroe-hamilton'],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'og': {'site_name': ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", 'description': 'Why in the hell do we still support Saudi Arabia?

For a little over a decade today鈥檚 millennials have been described as being part of the 鈥渆veryone gets a trophy generation.鈥?Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday鈥檚 NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of 鈥淚slamophobia?鈥?This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here鈥檚 what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and 鈥榮elective enforcement鈥?based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with 鈥榖aseless鈥?tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: 鈥楳uslims don鈥檛 belong here鈥? The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you鈥檙e not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. 鈥淚t was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,鈥?Bollwage said, adding, 鈥淚t had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.鈥?
Rahami鈥檚 family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can鈥檛 beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama鈥檚 America 鈥?where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg,"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don鈥檛 vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn鈥檛 been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we鈥檝e seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was 鈥淧apa鈥?John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees鈥?hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn鈥檛.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn鈥檛 get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl鈥檚 Jr. and Hardee鈥檚. Here鈥檚 one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that鈥檚 not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn鈥檛 want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

鈥淚 want to try it,鈥?CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. 鈥淲e could have a restaurant that鈥檚 focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.鈥?鈥淲ith government driving up the cost of labor, it鈥檚 driving down the number of jobs,鈥?he says. 鈥淵ou鈥檙e going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.鈥?鈥淭his is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,鈥?says Puzder. 鈥淒oes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?鈥?Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He鈥檚 hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don鈥檛 see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That鈥檚 just the way he is: profits over people.",[],[],"{'publisher': 'Groopspeak', 'description': ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", 'generator': 'WordPress 4.6.1', 'author': 'admin', 'og': {'site_name': 'AddictingInfo', 'description': ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time.  <a href="", 'title': 'Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency', 'url': 'http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/', 'image': 'http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg', 'locale': 'en_US', 'type': 'article'}, 'twitter': {'description': ""This might be the worst CEO in the country and no, it's not Papa John this time."", 'creator': '@editor', 'url': 'http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/', 'image': 'http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg', 'title': 'Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency', 'site': '@groopspeak', 'card': 'summary_large_image'}, 'apple-mobile-web-app-capable': 'yes', 'fb': {'app_id': 636595649691481}, 'viewport': 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=1.0'}",http://news.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,"['http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif', 'http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/themes/groopspeaknews_v2/images/pageflipbg.png', 'http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/breakingnews1.jpg', 'http://news.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-18-at-7.00.30-PM.jpg', 'http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d9f072e9130198dc6fe7f2d500663cd0?s=70&d=mm&r=g']",Fast Food CEO Threatens To Fire Everyone If A Democrat Wins The Presidency,http://author.groopspeak.com/fast-food-ceo-threatens-to-fire-everyone-if-a-democrat-wins-the-presidency/,,['https://www.youtube.com/embed/uxPlxd7yjy0'],,http://author.groopspeak.com

The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism鈥?and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary鈥檚 top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey鈥檚 fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. 鈥淭his now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director鈥檚 fitness for office,鈥?DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills鈥?computer. 鈥淭he contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,鈥?he said. 鈥淭his was not a real investigation. This was a 鈥榩rotected investigation鈥?designed to look like an investigation.鈥?
DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn鈥檛 just having to face a hearing; he鈥檚 been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton鈥檚 email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her?

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel鈥檚 conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a 鈥渓iving lie.鈥?
According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, 鈥榳e can do this鈥? but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. 鈥楢 continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,鈥?she said. The leader, once known as the 鈥業ron Chancellor鈥? won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. 鈥榃e want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,鈥?she told the conference in Karlsruhe. 鈥榃ith an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.鈥?
Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a 鈥渓iving lie.鈥?Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it鈥檚 not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they鈥檙e not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who鈥檝e fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that鈥檚 the truth in Obama鈥檚 America.

We鈥檙e all aware of the scandal at the Veteran鈥檚 Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

鈥淲e have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,鈥?he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. 鈥淭hank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.鈥?Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. 鈥淏ut the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,鈥?said Trump. 鈥淗e will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he鈥檒l probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.鈥?
Watch below:

Wouldn鈥檛 it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care 鈥?a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans 鈥?don鈥檛 you think it鈥檚 time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can鈥檛 imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I鈥檇 be tempted to make a medical 鈥渆rror鈥?or two.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.', 'og': {'site_name': 'Freedom Daily', 'description': ""Here's a SICK fact about Obama's America..."", 'title': 'DISGUSTING!

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it鈥檚 one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises鈥?because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton鈥?EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn鈥檛 tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer鈥檚 Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer鈥檚 to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers 鈥渋mmunity.鈥?It鈥檚 an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.', 'og': {'site_name': 'Freedom Daily', 'description': 'Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.', 'title': 'DESPICABLE!

Hillary Wants To Put Hero Cop Who Stopped Mall Terror Attack Out Of BUSINESS 鈰?Freedom Daily,http://freedomdaily.com/despicable-hillary-wants-put-hero-cop-stopped-mall-terror-attack-business/,,[],{'$date': 1474396550000},http://freedomdaily.com

I don鈥檛 recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton鈥檚 health constantly making headline, but it鈥檚 also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

鈥ore than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either 鈥渂elow average鈥?or 鈥渧ery poor鈥?health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That鈥檚 a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

鈥he share of voters who think Clinton鈥檚 health is 鈥渁verage鈥?remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either 鈥渁bove average鈥?or 鈥渆xcellent鈥?health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

鈥oters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton鈥檚 potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she鈥檚 one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60鈥檚 too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually 鈥榣ooking old鈥?or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can鈥檛 see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary鈥檚 health. The suspicion isn鈥檛 from one particular thing, it鈥檚 from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady鈥檚. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson鈥檚, Alzheimer鈥檚, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting 鈥榗onfused and needing naps鈥? of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn鈥檛 mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone鈥檚 arm.



Here鈥檚 an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don鈥檛 see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she鈥檚 gasping for air. It鈥檚 incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack 鈥?*GASP excuse me, President of the United States.

I鈥an鈥檛鈥ven.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I鈥檓 trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can鈥檛 wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don鈥檛 understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It鈥檚 just鈥?is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It鈥檚 going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore鈥?it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of 鈥渁ll things dangerous鈥?then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It鈥檚 not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn鈥檛 already hard enough in Obama鈥檚 America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being 鈥渄isproportionately鈥?targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that鈥檚 鈥渞easonable suspicion鈥?and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it鈥檚 not important to get evidence when it鈥檚 fresh, because it could hurt a thug鈥檚 feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve鈥f there鈥檚 a runner.

Which鈥et鈥檚 be real, what thug doesn鈥檛 run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I鈥檓 so funny.

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump鈥檚 campaign website.

Sansaricq鈥檚 statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer鈥檚 book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

鈥淚f I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.鈥?
These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin鈥檚 Sunday elections. She also said,

鈥淚f I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.鈥?
She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

鈥淚f people don鈥檛 want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany鈥檚. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.鈥?
Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

鈥淚t is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.鈥?
The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain鈥檛 broke don鈥檛 fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama鈥檚 and Hillary Clinton鈥檚. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand her.",[],[],"{'description': ""German chancellor Angela Merkel's political party suffered a landslide defeat in their elections.

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn鈥檛 to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren鈥檛 supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a 鈥榙isobedient鈥?woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 鈥?So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband鈥檚] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance 鈥?[first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of 鈥渂eat them,鈥?the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims which he is following.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.', 'og': {'site_name': 'Freedom Daily', 'description': 'He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard do of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money.', 'title': 'SICK!

Muslim Refugee Beats, Urinates On Pregnant Woman After Seeing What She Has 鈰?Freedom Daily",http://freedomdaily.com/sick-muslim-refugee-beats-urinates-on-pregnant-woman-after-seeing-what-she-has/,,[],{'$date': 1474489591000},http://freedomdaily.com
http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Trump-Bannon.jpg,"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

鈥淭here鈥檚 actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won鈥檛 know the law, and they鈥檒l be engaging in discriminatory challenges,鈥?Gitlin said. 鈥淭hat can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.鈥?
As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that鈥檚 exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

鈥淲e鈥檙e going to watch Pennsylvania,鈥?Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. 鈥淕o down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don鈥檛 come in and vote five times. If you do that, we鈥檙e not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion 鈥?I really mean this, Pennsylvania 鈥?is if cheating goes on.鈥?
Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to 鈥淪top Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!鈥?
In response to Trump鈥檚 claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump鈥檚 favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn鈥檛 think that they鈥檙e an American themselves. Such wasn鈥檛 the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she鈥檚 representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City鈥?I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don鈥檛 come even close to things we鈥檝e seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It鈥檚 ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.鈥?
How terrible 鈥?but let鈥檚 not pretend that we live in an 鈥淚slamophobic鈥?country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn鈥檛 she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer 鈥?because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She鈥檚 not going to be stoned to death in America. She鈥檚 not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She鈥檚 not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She鈥檚 not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that鈥檚 what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'generator': 'Powered by

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a 鈥減eaceful protest鈥?into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can鈥檛 even play the race card on this one, but they鈥檒l still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn鈥檛 listen to police.

That must mean it鈥檚 time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don鈥檛 even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News 鈥?Rioters swarmed this man鈥檚 injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It鈥檚 okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don鈥檛 know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn鈥檛 be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I鈥檇 probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they鈥檇 be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They鈥檙e the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They鈥檙e a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they鈥檙e white. They attack people just because they鈥檙e white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can鈥檛. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

Based off what I鈥檝e seen so far, I can proudly say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he鈥檚 enjoying that Gilligan鈥檚 Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It鈥檚 like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

Watch President Obama鈥檚 full speech here,",[],[],"{'description': 'President Obama gave a speech at the United Nations general assembly where he called for THIS. Absolutely ridiculous!

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick鈥檚 protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, 鈥淭ebowing鈥?celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows鈥?
鈥淲hen people have belief in something,鈥?said Tebow, 鈥渙r conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it鈥檚 all about standing for it the right way.鈥?
Keyword is 鈥淪TANDING鈥?which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He鈥檚 a high paid bench player and he鈥檚 being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that鈥檚 cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald鈥檚 next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let鈥檚 not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you鈥檙e oppressed is really you admitting you鈥檙e lazy and don鈥檛 want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn鈥檛 oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he鈥檚 smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He鈥檚 too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

A border wall isn鈥檛 just to keep out illegal immigrants 鈥?it acts as a national security measure. China didn鈥檛 build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they鈥檝e racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying鈥?
As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. 鈥淏order Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,鈥?he said. 鈥淥ur agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.鈥?
It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that 鈥淓ight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,鈥?Garza explained. 鈥淯nfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.鈥?
We need a border and stronger border security 鈥?and there鈥檚 only one Presidential candidate willing to help with both.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer -

http://www.yesimright.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/radicalmuslim5_1.jpg,"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what鈥檚 going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn鈥檛 a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they鈥檒l go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they鈥檙e flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says 鈥淎merica first鈥?it鈥檚 suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. 鈥淔loored鈥?by the results, the pollster laments that the 鈥渂asket of deplorables鈥? who he previously thought were just a 鈥渕arginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia鈥? is too big to ignore. He writes: 鈥淭his not a 鈥榖asket of deplorables鈥?who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. 鈥淵es, they are more likely to vote Coalition or 鈥榦ther鈥?but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.鈥?
Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don鈥檛 call them 鈥渄eplorables,鈥?you recognize that half the country is against you. Let鈥檚 get this done in November.

You can鈥檛 make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I鈥檝e ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they鈥檙e even better when they鈥檙e in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they鈥檙e still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I鈥檝e watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone鈥檚 deplorable brain when they鈥檙e thinking 鈥?well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let鈥檚 just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It鈥檚 not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it鈥檚 a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they鈥檙e in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren鈥檛 getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let鈥檚 a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

No one cares anymore.

Time to start caring about people and stop lighting them on fire.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.', 'og':

The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.

Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn鈥檛 end there 鈥?any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions鈥?and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child鈥檚 actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children.

鈥淧arents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,鈥?city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. 鈥淢any of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.鈥?

Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know鈥?act like parents. Let鈥檚 be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there鈥檚 a good chance you鈥檙e not doing a good job at parenting.

There鈥檚 a reason that it鈥檚 called terrorism. It鈥檚 because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want. With ISIS and other Islamic terrorists, what they want is to force people to convert to Islam and live their lives subservient to their Muslim rulers. Anyone who refuses is branded an infidel and faces death. ISIS even puts out hit lists of those who they want to target for their non-belief.

While the notion of being put on a terrorist hit list may strike fear into most people鈥檚 hearts, Marines aren鈥檛 bothered in the slightest. They welcome it, actually, because if the terrorists try to attack the Marines, then they don鈥檛 have to worry about hunting them down. Not only are they not intimidated, they鈥檙e rubbing their lack of intimidation in the terrorists鈥?faces.

A series of billboards have been erected across the nation to let terrorists know that Marines are ready for them. And it surely will make terrorists think twice before taking on the United States Marine Corps:

脳 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now

Considering how many terrorist attacks the United States has seen over the past year, there couldn鈥檛 be a better time for the Marine Corps to send this message to the terrorists. Liberals were furious over it naturally, but they will bend over backwards to placate terrorists and will do everything they can to prevent Americans from being able to defend themselves. Who cares what they think?

And this message drives a stake right through the heart of the terrorist agenda. Remember, what they want is to make people afraid. These billboards show that not only are the Marines not afraid, they鈥檙e ready to take the fight to the terrorists. If we鈥檙e not afraid, then the terrorists lose.

Sorry, ISIS. Game over.

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life鈥檚 purposes to serve and help his 鈥榖rothers and sisters鈥?in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith鈥e learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

鈥淚n terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,鈥?Wilson concluded. 鈥淚 think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don鈥檛 stress out about much.鈥?
It鈥檚 a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to鈥?themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men鈥檚 hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama鈥檚 America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there鈥f you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share鈥?corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith鈥?
Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don鈥檛 talk about God, it hurts people鈥檚 feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it鈥檚 heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening鈥he truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like 鈥榯olerance鈥?are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

鈥nd Obama鈥檚 Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth.",[],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'generator': 'Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.', 'og':

Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt鈥檚 infamous line, 鈥渨e have nothing to fear but fear itself,鈥?the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of 鈥渢errorism鈥?and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of 鈥渢errorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue鈥? he said. 鈥淭his is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.鈥?Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy鈥檚 press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I鈥檓 sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that鈥檚 what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American鈥檚 odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that鈥檚 about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn鈥檛 directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they鈥檝e succeeded.

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump鈥檚 tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton鈥檚 win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent 鈥渨inning鈥?results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton鈥檚 infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let鈥檚 not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton鈥檚 campaign. We all must wait and see.",[],[],"{'description': 'Early polls show that Hillary Clinton won the first presidential debate but other sources and polls indicate otherwise.

The polls are in from last night鈥檚 debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night鈥檚 debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday鈥檚 presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz鈥檚 group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN鈥檚 group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz鈥檚 group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn鈥檛 do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump 鈥渢anked鈥?when 鈥渢rying to explain why he questioned Obama鈥檚 birthplace for so long.鈥?
But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying 鈥?and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: 鈥淚 didn鈥檛 want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.鈥?
My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 鈥?Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. 鈥?BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

鈥淚 didn鈥檛 realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let鈥檚 march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said 鈥淗ands Up, Don鈥檛 Shoot,鈥?Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

鈥淭he protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,鈥?Meyer told me almost breathlessly, 鈥淚鈥檝e been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant 鈥榟ands up, don鈥檛 shoot鈥?and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.鈥?
鈥淎fter leaving 鈥楾he Epicenter,鈥?police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful 鈥?and that鈥檚 when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.鈥?
Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, 鈥渙h, absolutely.鈥?
Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

鈥淚t wasn鈥檛 a gunshot,鈥?she told us. 鈥淚t was much louder. It wasn鈥檛 a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly 鈥楾hey just shot him鈥?and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn鈥檛 already left, exited.鈥?
At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was 鈥榚ntirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.鈥?
CNN reports, 鈥淧olice say the person was shot by a civilian.鈥?
The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester鈥檚 grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. 鈥?City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police鈥檚 claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

鈥淚 saw the man go down on the pavement,鈥?said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, 鈥淚t was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.鈥?
#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV 鈥?Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook 鈥?which was also shared via twitter 鈥?that, 鈥渨ithin 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.鈥?
When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how 鈥?with more violence.

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He鈥檚 surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he鈥檚 being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. 鈥淔or the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia鈥?he tweeted in July. Now 鈥?brace yourself, this might come as a shock 鈥?it appears he鈥檚 been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has 鈥渘umerous ties鈥?to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. 鈥淭he level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars 鈥?what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate鈥擺and] be associated with Donald Trump鈥?says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to 鈥渓arge numbers鈥?of Russian buyers 鈥?so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as 鈥淟ittle Moscow.鈥?
The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense 鈥?they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

鈥淚 think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption鈥hey don鈥檛 read books. They don鈥檛 go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht鈥?says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as 鈥渃ultural ignoramuses鈥ot interested in social justice.鈥?Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow鈥檚 annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves 鈥?and Trump himself. 鈥淲e鈥檒l be looking at that, yeah we鈥檒l be looking鈥?said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it鈥檚 that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

New Jersey鈥檚 despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the 鈥淏ridgegate鈥?scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential鈥檚 nominee Donald Trump鈥檚 transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world鈥檚 busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump鈥檚 most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major 鈥渃onservative鈥?Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump鈥檚 benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It鈥檚 have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor鈥檚 the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration鈥檚 bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year鈥檚 Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because 鈥渉e would鈥檝e gotten it, if I wanted it.鈥?But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul 鈥?this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie鈥攁 detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump鈥檚 mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn鈥檛 want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush鈥檚 story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies鈥攈e had played the 鈥渃ash for outcomes鈥?political game for years鈥攈e could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush鈥檚 opposition鈥攊f Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would鈥檝e full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump鈥檚 na茂ve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald鈥檚 point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn鈥檛 been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple鈥擳rump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater 鈥渟candal鈥?for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump鈥檚 other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party鈥檚 base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it鈥檚 head.

Trump鈥檚 penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it鈥檚 a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there鈥檚 no third option here:

Bush: 鈥淭he one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something鈥攖hat was generous and gave me money鈥攚as Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.鈥?Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn鈥檛鈥?Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn鈥檛 get it, because I was opposed to鈥?Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before鈥?Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I鈥檓 not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, 鈥淒id you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?鈥?Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush鈥nd I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn鈥檛 you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn鈥檛 change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

CBS exposing Obama paying for the renovation of mosques is actually a story from 2015. But it got little media attention then and he鈥檚 still doing it. He鈥檚 diverting hundreds of millions of US dollars to overseas mosques to renovate them. Tell me again how he is not a Muslim. This just screams it. And people wonder why he grovels before the Mullahs of Iran鈥?why he gives ISIS a pass鈥?why he is terraforming the US into a Muslim nation.

Set aside for a moment that we are broke, due to Marxist policies implemented ever since Reagan left office鈥?it鈥檚 where the money is being spent that makes your blood run cold. By all accounts, we are funding Islamic terrorists right and left. We are funding their countries, their schools, their mosques鈥?we are funding their wars as well, even against America.

From TruthFeed:

鈥淵ou Didn鈥檛 Build That鈥濃€h Wait, You Did! A CBS news investigation found that the Obama State Department is sending hundreds of millions of dollars to save mosques overseas 鈥?outraging taxpayer advocates and raising enormous questions about aid to potentially terror-supporting groups with U.S. foreign aid. 脳 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The United States 鈥榠nvestment鈥?of millions to refurbish mosques as a 鈥榞ood-will effort鈥?in Muslim countries has upset many. 鈥淲e are spending money we don鈥檛 have. This is all on a gigantic credit card right now,鈥?said Jared Thomas, a taxpayer advocate. Millions more dollars have been sent to places like Cyprus. The State Department displays before and after pictures of mosques refurbished with U.S. tax dollars.

Many of us lost almost everything in the last economic downturn. Fully one third of Americans are now out of work. We can鈥檛 make ends meet and our country can鈥檛 pay its bills鈥?yet somehow, Obama can send well over $770 million to Islamic countries to refurbish their mosques. It makes your eyes bleed.

The State Department declined a CBS Atlanta News request for an interview. Anchor Justin Farmer wanted to ask why we are using tax dollars to refurbish religious buildings overseas 鈥?something we all want to know. The State Department did send CBS Atlanta News an email saying that they are: 鈥淔ighting Islamic extremism by building relationships with Islamic leaders.鈥?What bovine excrement.

Let me spell it out. Our so-called wealth is being redistributed to Islamists and their countries. Our treasury is being emptied and given to terrorists. Then we invite these enemies in and place them in positions of power in the US. And while we are at it, we bring in hundreds of thousands of Muslim refugees and place them throughout the country, especially in conservative strongholds, thereby changing and controlling the voting demographic.

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight鈥檚 debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon 鈥?thank you! 鈥?Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What鈥檚 curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from 鈥?which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That鈥檚 right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin鈥檚 agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It鈥檚 a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin鈥檚 trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: 鈥渉umourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.鈥?
So remember 鈥?don鈥檛 trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

S Trump鈥檚 number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company鈥檚 hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment鈥檚 protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump鈥檚 campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. 鈥淭he likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,鈥?the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee鈥檚 most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel鈥檚 parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he鈥檚 supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan鈥檚 secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire鈥檚 then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP鈥檚 bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, 鈥淓very American has a unique identity. I鈥檓 proud to be gay, I鈥檓 proud to be a Republican,鈥?after a lengthy rant against 鈥済overnment incompetence.鈥?He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn鈥檛 pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

鈥淔ederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,鈥?said the Department of Labor鈥檚 OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. 鈥淥ur nation鈥檚 taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.鈥?Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself 鈥渧igorously鈥?and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer 鈥?the federal government 鈥?of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company鈥檚 hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 鈥?A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 鈥?A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: 鈥淚鈥檓 looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.鈥?
Lead #3 鈥?A Tumblr page called 鈥業鈥檓 the NY Bomber鈥?that claims to be the 鈥渕anifesto鈥?of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE.

Buy Now You probably have all seen the news by now, the explosives detonated in New York City, that was me. Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That鈥檚 implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late.

Someone is lying and it鈥檚 just sick that anyone would want to claim this, especially one who didn鈥檛 even do it.

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he鈥檚 obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He鈥檚 constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He鈥檚 a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He鈥檚 been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to 鈥渞elax鈥?he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It鈥檚 obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he鈥檚 set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he鈥檚 simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump鈥檚 mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it鈥檚 just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! 鈥?Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just鈥hat is he talking about? If you鈥檙e trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He鈥檚 obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all鈥?when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It鈥檚 looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton鈥檚 Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. 脳 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here鈥?the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump鈥檚 rallies are packed with thousands of people鈥?he鈥檚 making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary鈥檚 health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it鈥檚 beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president.",['Terresa Monroe-hamilton'],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'og': {'site_name': ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", 'description': 'Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton.

I鈥檓 guessing that if you鈥檙e reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.

While you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.

Surely you鈥檇 want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.

Well apparently your President doesn鈥檛 have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the 鈥渟exism鈥?he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I鈥檝e ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton鈥檚 campaign is going down the tubes.

He bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.

Critics will say that he didn鈥檛 have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don鈥檛 have to know every single detail to say 鈥渁n explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed 鈥渨atered down鈥?drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed 鈥渨atered-down鈥?HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and 鈥渓ikely increased鈥?the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. 鈥?The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation鈥檚 most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. 鈥?The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton鈥檚 campaign. 鈥?The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation鈥檚 vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the 鈥渨atered-down鈥?drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

https://www.chicksontheright.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016-09-19-20-46-49.jpg,"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don鈥檛 end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child鈥檚 genitals, so if you鈥檙e a parent of a child and you鈥檝e changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you鈥檙e a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from 鈥渋ntentionally or knowingly touching鈥?the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don鈥檛 know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that 鈥減rosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.鈥?They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y鈥檃ll. There鈥檚 no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here鈥檚 an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority鈥檚 logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court鈥檚 help, Arizona鈥檚 child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver鈥攐ut of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state鈥檚 residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona鈥檚 parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I鈥檓 sure it鈥檒l all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y鈥檃ll.

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her 鈥渇aith鈥?and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative. Anything with 鈥楥linton鈥?in it has to be corrupt, but this resulted in the deaths of many, many Africans. They distributed 鈥渨atered-down鈥?HIV/AIDs drugs to patients, virtually sentencing them to death. An Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy was behind this鈥?the question is, did the Clintons know about it. I鈥檓 betting that they did.

Ranbaxy was eventually found guilty in 2013 on seven counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce. The DOJ also levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture against the company. So, one wonders why the Clintons were not also looked into and questioned on all of this.

鈥淭his is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation鈥檚 largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,鈥?said US Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed 鈥渨atered-down鈥?HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and 鈥渓ikely increased鈥?the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. The congressional report, titled,鈥淭he Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,鈥?was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation鈥檚 most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. 脳 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The congressional report focused on Clinton鈥檚 decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries. It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market. Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

鈥淭he question becomes, 鈥榟ow many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,鈥欌€?asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation鈥檚 aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the 鈥渨atered-down鈥?drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered 鈥渕ore than $1.8 million packages.鈥?鈥淪ubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,鈥?Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy鈥檚 generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton鈥檚 charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant. Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general鈥?their primary interest is monetary.",['Terresa Monroe-hamilton'],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'og': {'site_name': ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", 'description': 'This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative.

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that鈥檚 no joke. They shouldn鈥檛 be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn鈥檛 do. It鈥檚 called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it鈥?I wouldn鈥檛 hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department鈥檚 motion to dismiss TheDCNF鈥檚 Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF鈥檚 request to depose State Department officials. 脳 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don鈥檛 look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail鈥?guess we just aren鈥檛 the 鈥榬ight people鈥?

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said 鈥淛udge Leon鈥檚 Order made clear his frustration with the State Department鈥檚 continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.鈥?I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It鈥檚 getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is 鈥榗orruption鈥?

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the 鈥渃ourses were not completed鈥?by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh.

http://addictinginfo.addictinginfoent.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/610197142.jpg,"There鈥檚 already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable 鈥?except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics 鈥? Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator 鈥?to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump鈥檚 impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it鈥檚 somehow up to Hillary Clinton to 鈥渟hine鈥?at the debate if she hopes to 鈥渨in.鈥?This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it鈥檚 that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

Dolly Kyle, author of 鈥淗illary the Other Woman,鈥?said Clinton has been 鈥溾€檆ruisin鈥?for a bruisin鈥?鈥?because she鈥檚 so angry and driven by rage. 鈥淧eople like that eventually break down, physically.鈥?

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton鈥檚 paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

鈥淭hat paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,鈥?Kyle said, and it鈥檚 simply not a good combination for anyone 鈥?much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton 鈥?and Clinton鈥檚 health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants 鈥?even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

鈥淪he has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton鈥檚 coattails so many decades ago in 1971,鈥?the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

There should be no more of this each to their own garbage when it comes to how immigrants want to live their lives. If they want to stick with their own programs then they should have stayed put in their countries of origin.

(Via JewsNews) Quebec mayor gives Muslim 鈥榬efugees鈥?a little piece of his mind by spilling the truth that Canadians don鈥檛 adapt to them, it鈥檚 the other way around.

鈥?MUSLIMS MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THEY MUST ADAPT TO CANADA, ITS CUSTOMS, ITS TRADITIONS, ITS WAY OF LIFE, BECAUSE IT WAS THE COUNTRY THAT WAS CHOSEN TO EMIGRATE. YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE THE ONES THAT THEY MUST INTEGRATE AND LEARN TO LIVE IN CANADA. NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE TO BE FOR THEM TO CHANGE THEIR LIFESTYLE, NOT THE CANADIANS WHO SO GENEROUSLY WELCOMED THEM. YOU MUST UNDERSTAND THAT CANADIANS ARE NOT RACIST OR XENOPHOBIC. WE ACCEPT MANY IMMIGRANTS, IN MANY COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT CULTURES AND RELIGIONS, CONTRADICTING TO MANY MUSLIM COUNTRIES WHICH DO NOT ACCEPT IMMIGRANTS NON-MUSLIMS. FOR THIS REASON, THE CANADIANS ARE NOT WILLING TO GIVE UP THEIR IDENTITY AND THEIR CULTURE. FINALLY, THEY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN CANADA, WITH ITS JUDEO-CHRISTIAN ROOTS, CHRISTMAS TREES, CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS FESTIVALS, RELIGION MUST REMAIN IN THE PRIVATE SPHERE. THE MUNICIPALITY OF DURVAL HAS THE RIGHT TO REFUSE ANY CONCESSIONS TO ISLAM AND SHARIA LAW. FOR MUSLIMS, WHO ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE CANADIAN CULTURE AND RELIGION AND DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN CANADA, THERE ARE 57 BEAUTIFUL MUSLIM COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, MOST OF THEM UNDER-POPULATED AND READY TO RECEIVE THEM WITH OPEN ARMS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH SHARIA LAW. IF YOU LEFT HIS COUNTRY TO COME TO CANADA, AND NOT TO A MUSLIM COUNTRY, IT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE CONSIDERED THAT LIFE IS BETTER IN CANADA THAN IN OTHER PLACES. HELP YOURSELF TO THE QUESTION, JUST ONCE: WHY IS IT BETTER HERE IN CANADA THAT WHERE IT COMES FROM.

It boggles my mind that many feel that they have the right or the authority to control other peoples lives. This is the direct opposite of what we feel as humans.

While most Americans are perplexed as to how a foreign entity could trump American law on our own sovereign soil, Texas isn鈥檛 waiting for the courts to intervene on the issue, but rather pass immediate legislation baring any attempt to institute Sharia law within the American Judicial System

Because Muslims cannot eat a particular meal, should mean they should bring their own. The few should never out weigh the many, especially when it comes to adopted culture. Adopt it, or don鈥檛. Just do block others from it. Boom. There it is. AND, that is the philosophy we ought to have.

Integrate or Vacate, but don鈥檛 try to change us. You will fail.","['Scott Osborn', 'Terresa Monroe-hamilton', 'Mr Wendal', 'Max Jackson']",[],"{'description': 'America needs to get with the program when it comes to immigration.

What do you do if you鈥檙e sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you鈥檙e surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Step one should obviously be to lock your doors to make it just a little bit harder for them to break in.

Step two is up to you. Do you put the pedal to the floor and power through? Do you call the police and wait.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we鈥檝e seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?",['Sierra Marlee'],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'og': {'site_name': ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", 'description': 'What do you do if you鈥檙e sitting in your vehicle and suddenly you鈥檙e surrounded by a seemingly hostile group?

Imagine that鈥?at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren鈥檛 so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them鈥?Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there鈥檚 a riot like this, it鈥檚 all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they鈥檙e even rioting about in the first place. No, no, that鈥檚 not sarcasm. Shut up. 脳 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now Take it away CNN鈥?鈥淭his is not Charlotte that鈥檚 out here. These are outside entities that are coming in and causing these problems. These are not protestors, these are criminals.鈥?鈥淲e鈥檝e got the instigators that are coming in from the outside. They were coming in on buses from out of state. If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They鈥檙e not coming from Charlotte.鈥?
I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It鈥檚 not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don鈥檛 care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos. That鈥檚 their goal鈥?it鈥檚 part of wanting to burn all of America down. It鈥檚 what communists do 鈥?they want their revolution and race wars and they want them now.",['Terresa Monroe-hamilton'],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'og': {'site_name': ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", 'description': 'Imagine that鈥?at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in.

Once considered a 鈥渃onspiracy theory,鈥?Americans now see that Hillary Clinton suffers from serious problems, including neurological diseases.

After her September 11th collapse and fainting, even the pro-Hillary media can鈥檛 hide the truth.

Now, expert Clif Hite (below) comes up with the most compelling theory about Hillary Clinton鈥檚 health yet, and you haven鈥檛 heard it before. He believes Hillary has died, and is replaced by multiple body doubles and CGI images. If true, this is the biggest coverup in the history of American politics. What a bombshell!:



As BeforeItsNews reports:

Note: Russian Intel is using my video to prove they used Green Screen in Greensboro! It鈥檚 all fake folks! You鈥檒l see my video below. The Russians who track Hillary say she never left Chelsea鈥檚 apartment and she鈥檚 using doubles! Also check out the part where Russia shows the emails proving Hillary was in a secret plane crash and hurt badly! At first they laugh at Sorcha Faal鈥檚 report but then admit it鈥檚 鈥渃redible鈥?

http://rightwingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/soros-trump.jpg,"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans鈥?PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they鈥檙e funded by Soros TOO! It鈥檚 called 鈥楥ommon Defense PAC鈥?and their mantra is: 鈥淎s veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.鈥?
Then on the 鈥榣eadership team鈥?page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called 鈥淪enator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.鈥?
The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org鈥檚 Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. 脳 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.鈥?The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to 鈥渦n-endorse Donald J. Trump.鈥?ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans 鈥渃ame to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.鈥?
Common sense PAC鈥檚 July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group鈥檚 Director, Perry O鈥橞rien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His 鈥業raq Veterans Against the War鈥?bio describes him:

Perry O鈥橞rien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan.

The PAC that鈥檚 suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O鈥橞rien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called 鈥淭ell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.鈥?The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O鈥橞rien to start the shallow PAC. With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros, do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left?",['Tiffiny Ruegner'],[],"{'googlebot': 'noimageindex', 'og': {'site_name': ""John Hawkins' Right Wing News"", 'description': 'A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros.
